But four thousand years ago, he was just a man - until he brought his people to Meluha, a near-perfect empire founded by the great king Lord Ram.

96e8bdd5-c111-44ce-9a63-5f5a5f025d51,fiction,Get to the Point!,Sharpen Your Message and Make Your Words Matter,Joel Schwartzberg,"In this indispensable guide for anyone who must communicate in speech or writing, Schwartzberg shows that most of us fail to convince because we don't have a point-a concrete contention that we can argue, defend, illustrate, and prove. He lays out, step-by-step, how to develop one. In Joel's Schwartzberg's ten-plus years as a strategic communications trainer, the biggest obstacle he's come across-one that connects directly to nervousness, stammering, rambling, and epic fail-is that most speakers and writers don't have a point. They typically have just a title, a theme, a topic, an idea, an assertion, a catchphrase, or even something much less. A point is something more. It's a contention you can propose, argue, defend, illustrate, and prove. A point offers a position of potential value. Global warming is real is not a point. Scientific evidence shows that global warming is a real, human-generated problem that will have a devastating environmental and financial impact is a point. When we have a point, our influence snaps into place. We communicate belief, conviction, and urgency. This book shows you how to identify your point, leverage it, stick to it, and sell it and how to train others to identify and successfully make their own points.","9781523094127, 1523094125",False,True,129,Business & Economics,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7EHKDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7EHKDgAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,Berrett-Koehler Publishers
e2e160d3-fe3f-4a72-acce-a47ec2d63737,fiction,Prose Fiction: An Introduction to the Semiotics of Narrative,N/A,Ignasi Ribó,"This concise and highly accessible textbook outlines the principles and techniques of storytelling. It is intended as a high-school and college-level introduction to the central concepts of narrative theory – concepts that will aid students in developing their competence not only in analysing and interpreting short stories and novels, but also in writing them. This textbook prioritises clarity over intricacy of theory, equipping its readers with the necessary tools to embark on further study of literature, literary theory and creative writing. Building on a ‘semiotic model of narrative,’ it is structured around the key elements of narratological theory, with chapters on plot, setting, characterisation, and narration, as well as on language and theme – elements which are underrepresented in existing textbooks on narrative theory. The chapter on language constitutes essential reading for those students unfamiliar with rhetoric, while the chapter on theme draws together significant perspectives from contemporary critical theory (including feminism and postcolonialism). This textbook is engaging and easily navigable, with key concepts highlighted and clearly explained, both in the text and in a full glossary located at the end of the book. Throughout the textbook the reader is aided by diagrams, images, quotes from prominent theorists, and instructive examples from classical and popular short stories and novels (such as Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Franz Kafka’s ‘The Metamorphosis,’ J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter, or Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov, amongst many others). Prose Fiction: An Introduction to the Semiotics of Narrative can either be incorporated as the main textbook into a wider syllabus on narrative theory and creative writing, or it can be used as a supplementary reference book for readers interested in narrative fiction. The textbook is a must-read for beginning students of narratology, especially those with no or limited prior experience in this area. It is of especial relevance to English and Humanities major students in Asia, for whom it was conceived and written.","9781783748129, 1783748125",True,True,119,Education,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TGDIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TGDIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2019,Open Book Publishers

She has inherited her father's love of the big screen but not his exuberant gothic style of filmmaking. Instead, Severin makes documentaries, artful and passionate and even rather brave - for she is a realist in a fantastic alternate universe, in which Hollywood occupies the moon, Mars is rife with lawless saloons, and the solar system contains all manner of creatures, cults and colonies. For Severin's latest project she leads her crew to the watery planet of Venus to investigate the disappearance of a diving colony there. But something goes wrong during the course of their investigations; and her crew limp home without her. All that remains of Severin are fragments. Can these snippets of scenes and shots, voices and memories, pages and recordings be collected and pieced together to tell the story of her life - and shed light on the mystery of her vanishing?

But more accurate to say that Legal Fiction is an urgent, literary report about how truth goes missing in our land. I read it with a racing heart. -- Amitava Kumar, author of The Lovers Chandan Pandey goes looking for the story that lurks just out of sight, getting under the skin of news headlines and extracting a story that is as compelling as it is devastating. -- Annie Zaidi, author of Prelude to a Riot Chandan Pandey has written a brilliant, gripping political novel. Legal Fiction is a nuanced, absorbing snapshot of our times -- it captures the minefield of hate politics, the intricate almost invisible fault-lines in relationships, and the power of art in imagining a better society. -- Meena Kandasamy, author of When I Hit You The Hindi novel was already destined to be a marker for this era. Now this translation fills a big gap, for no work originally written in English in India has scratched the surface of what Legal Fiction approaches the cold, dark centre of. Here, in the form of a thriller and the tone of an elegy, is a sharp look at a terrifying Indian -ism and the currents against it. Be ready for a heart of darkness. -- Tanuj Solanki, author of Diwali in Muzaffarnagar Legal fiction: A rule assuming as true something that is clearly false. Often used to get around the provisions of constitutions and legal codes. A late-night phone call from his ex-girlfriend Anasuya forces writer Arjun Kumar to leave his wife and home in Delhi and travel to the mofussil town of Noma on the UP-Bihar border. The reason -- Anasuya's husband, Rafique Neel, a college professor and theatre director, has mysteriously disappeared. Soon after he arrives, Arjun realizes that things are not as they seem: the police are refusing to register a missing-persons case, Rafique's student Janaki has also disappeared, and the locals are determined to turn it into a case of 'love jihad'. And when Arjun begins to dig deeper, what he finds endangers him and everyone around him.

Vollmann,"With his first three works of fiction—the novels You Bright and Risen Angels and The Ice-Shirt, and the collection The Rainbow Stories—William T. Vollmann announced himself as a writer of rare and ferocious talent, with critics comparing him to William Burroughs, Thomas Pynchon, and T.C. Boyle. His new novel is the story of Jimmy, who has been deserted by his lover, a prostitute by the name of Gloria. In the despair of his loneliness, and his drunken grief, he reassembles Gloria’s presence out of whatever he can buy from the hookers on the street—the fragments of their lives and dreams, and locks of hair they are willing to share for a price. In his search for these snatches of intimacy he meets the hustlers, drunks, and prostitutes of San Francisco’s Tenderloin district: Candy, who beats her customers when they ask for it but refuses to let them call her a bitch; Snake, who pimps his wife; Nicole, whose job it is to give men AIDS; Jack, who shoots his woman’s earnings into his arm but still likes Chopin even though he doesn’t have a record player; and Gloria, who may or may not be a figment of Jimmy’s imagination. Vollmann writes with explosive power of the inner city, unflinching in the way he confronts the solitude of the homeless and unloved, the insulted and the injured of skid-row America. His exhilarating, high-voltage style and lyric language touch the heart and retrieve a jubilant integrity from the harsh struggles of his characters. Here is a world of harrowing truth, beautifully expressed by a writer of prodigious gifts.","9780307827722, 0307827720",True,False,163,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7PrQDToTBJUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7PrQDToTBJUC&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2013,Pantheon

87b2b451-bcb8-4362-938f-38dece6e0941,fiction,Great Expectations [1867 Edition] Paperback,The Thirteenth Novel by Charles Dickens and His Penultimate Completed Novel,Charles Dickens,"Great Expectations is the thirteenth novel by Charles Dickens and his penultimate completed novel; a bildungsroman that depicts the personal growth and personal development of an orphan nicknamed Pip. It is Dickens's second novel, after David Copperfield, to be fully narrated in the first person. The novel was first published as a serial in Dickens' weekly periodical All the Year Round, from 1 December 1860 to August 1861. In October 1861, Chapman and Hall published the novel in three volumes.Charles Dickens's Great Expectations tells the story of Pip, an English orphan who rises to wealth, deserts his true friends, and becomes humbled by his own arrogance. It also introduces one of the more colorful characters in literature: Miss Havisham. Charles Dickens set Great Expectations during the time that England was becoming a wealthy world power. Machines were making factories more productive, yet people lived in awful conditions, and such themes carry into the story.The novel is set in Kent and London in the early to mid-19th century and contains some of Dickens's most memorable scenes, including the opening in a graveyard, where the young Pip is accosted by the escaped convict, Abel Magwitch. Great Expectations is full of extreme imagery-poverty, prison ships and chains, and fights to the death-and has a colourful cast of characters who have entered popular culture. These include the eccentric Miss Havisham, the beautiful but cold Estella, and Joe, the unsophisticated and kind blacksmith. Dickens's themes include wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil. Great Expectations, which is popular both with readers and literary critics, has been translated into many languages and adapted numerous times into various media.Upon its release, the novel received near universal acclaim. Although Dickens's contemporary Thomas Carlyle referred to it disparagingly as that ""Pip nonsense,"" he nevertheless reacted to each fresh instalment with ""roars of laughter."" Later, George Bernard Shaw praised the novel, as ""All of one piece and consistently truthful."" During the serial publication, Dickens was pleased with public response to Great Expectations and its sales; when the plot first formed in his mind, he called it ""a very fine, new and grotesque idea.""In what may be Dickens's best novel, humble, orphaned Pip is apprenticed to the dirty work of the forge but dares to dream of becoming a gentleman - and one day, under sudden and enigmatic circumstances, he finds himself in possession of ""great expectations."" In this gripping tale of crime and guilt, revenge and reward, the compelling characters include Magwitch, the fearful and fearsome convict; Estella, whose beauty is excelled only by her haughtiness; and the embittered Miss Havisham, an eccentric jilted bride","1979397848, 9781979397841",False,False,504,N/A,en,No Image,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0vP4swEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,N/A

Why is this? Michael Austin asks, inUseful Fictions. Why, in particular, are human beings, whose very survival depends on obtaining true information, so drawn to fictional narratives? After all, virtually every human culture reveres some form of storytelling. Might there be an evolutionary reason behind our species' need for stories? Drawing on evolutionary biology, anthropology, narrative theory, cognitive psychology, game theory, and evolutionary aesthetics, Austin develops the concept of a ""useful fiction,"" a simple narrative that serves an adaptive function unrelated to its factual accuracy. In his work we see how these useful fictions play a key role in neutralizing the overwhelming anxiety that humans can experience as their minds gather and process information. Rudimentary narratives constructed for this purpose, Austin suggests, provided a cognitive scaffold that might have become the basis for our well-documented love of fictional stories. Written in clear, jargon-free prose and employing abundant literary examplesfrom the Bible toOne Thousand and One Arabian NightsandDon QuixotetoNo ExitAustin's work offers a new way of understanding the relationship between fiction and evolutionary processesand, perhaps, the very origins of literature.","9780803232976, 0803232977",True,True,193,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LKD7Kg94oEwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LKD7Kg94oEwC&source=gbs_api,2011,U of Nebraska Press

An assassin’s code is simple: Kill or be killed. No prey, no pay. Every life has a price. If Jayne doesn’t fulfill her contract and kill Hadrian, she’ll be the next target on the League’s menu. But as old enemies return to hunt them both, they quickly learn that neither will survive unless they can learn to trust each other. Yet things are never so simple and survival means only one of them can be left standing . . .",,True,True,146,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sFY-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sFY-EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2022,Oliver-Heber books

b4511a4f-04ec-4273-9a0c-52da071e63b9,fiction,Why Women Read Fiction,The Stories of Our Lives,Helen Taylor,"Ian McEwan once said, 'When women stop reading, the novel will be dead.' This book explains how precious fiction is to contemporary women readers, and how they draw on it to tell the stories of their lives. Female readers are key to the future of fiction and—as parents, teachers, and librarians—the glue for a literate society. Women treasure the chance to read alone, but have also gregariously shared reading experiences and memories with mothers, daughters, grandchildren, and female friends. For so many, reading novels and short stories enables them to escape and to spread their wings intellectually and emotionally. This book, written by an experienced teacher, scholar of women's writing, and literature festival director, draws on over 500 interviews with and questionnaires from women readers and writers. It describes how, where, and when British women read fiction, and examines why stories and writers influence the way female readers understand and shape their own life stories. Taylor explores why women are the main buyers and readers of fiction, members of book clubs, attendees at literary festivals, and organisers of days out to fictional sites and writers' homes. The book analyses the special appeal and changing readership of the genres of romance, erotica, and crime. It also illuminates the reasons for British women's abiding love of two favourite novels, Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre. Taylor offers a cornucopia of witty and wise women's voices, of both readers themselves and also writers such as Hilary Mantel, Helen Dunmore, Katie Fforde, and Sarah Dunant. The book helps us understand why—in Jackie Kay's words—'our lives are mapped by books.'","9780192562678, 0192562673",True,True,299,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2qnDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2qnDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2019,Oxford University Press

She has no words for that night at the lighthouse when their lives changed forever. What happened to cleave her apart from her best friend and soulmate, Kase? Sylvie yearns to rekindle their deep connection, so when Kase invites her to the wild Tasmanian coast to celebrate her 40th birthday, she accepts - despite the ghosts she must face.

As she wages war against necromancers and demons, Violet learns to overcome her internal monsters as well. In this groundbreaking comic book for teens and young adults, we meet Violet—a witch whose parents were murdered by an evil necromancer when she was only six years old. Running from country to country, as well as from herself, Violet never gets a chance to fully process her traumatic experience. When she turns 19, Violet begins training at the Underworld Intelligence Agency (UIA) in hopes of becoming a Dark Agent—someone tasked with keeping the balance between the world of the living and the world of the undead. During her training, Violet hopes to finally overcome her fear of death and take control of her emotions, but instead she finds that mindfulness, vulnerability, and acceptance are the skills most necessary to help her succeed. Blended seamlessly throughout the story are elements of a powerful and evidence-based treatment called acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Whether or not you’ve experienced a traumatic event like Violet, you’ll find valuable skills you can apply to your own life to help you conquer your demons and hone your unique superpowers. Note for therapists: Dark Agents presents the core skills of ACT in a fun, narrative format to appeal to teen readers. In this comic, teens will learn all about mindfulness, defusion, self-compassion, and values-based living.

He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn’t heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom.

Why is this? Michael Austin asks, inUseful Fictions. Why, in particular, are human beings, whose very survival depends on obtaining true information, so drawn to fictional narratives? After all, virtually every human culture reveres some form of storytelling. Might there be an evolutionary reason behind our species' need for stories? Drawing on evolutionary biology, anthropology, narrative theory, cognitive psychology, game theory, and evolutionary aesthetics, Austin develops the concept of a ""useful fiction,"" a simple narrative that serves an adaptive function unrelated to its factual accuracy. In his work we see how these useful fictions play a key role in neutralizing the overwhelming anxiety that humans can experience as their minds gather and process information. Rudimentary narratives constructed for this purpose, Austin suggests, provided a cognitive scaffold that might have become the basis for our well-documented love of fictional stories. Written in clear, jargon-free prose and employing abundant literary examplesfrom the Bible toOne Thousand and One Arabian NightsandDon QuixotetoNo ExitAustin's work offers a new way of understanding the relationship between fiction and evolutionary processesand, perhaps, the very origins of literature.","9780803232976, 0803232977",True,True,193,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LKD7Kg94oEwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LKD7Kg94oEwC&source=gbs_api,2011,U of Nebraska Press

b0d43aa7-d48d-4cd6-9254-3d737b4a7c5b,fiction,Mestizos Come Home!,Making and Claiming Mexican American Identity,Robert Con Davis-Undiano,"Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano has described U.S. and Latin American culture as continually hobbled by amnesia—unable, or unwilling, to remember the influence of mestizos and indigenous populations. In Mestizos Come Home! author Robert Con Davis-Undiano documents the great awakening of Mexican American and Latino culture since the 1960s that has challenged this omission in collective memory. He maps a new awareness of the United States as intrinsically connected to the broader context of the Americas. At once native and new to the American Southwest, Mexican Americans have “come home” in a profound sense: they have reasserted their right to claim that land and U.S. culture as their own. Mestizos Come Home! explores key areas of change that Mexican Americans have brought to the United States. These areas include the recognition of mestizo identity, especially its historical development across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; the re-emergence of indigenous relationships to land; and the promotion of Mesoamerican conceptions of the human body. Clarifying and bridging critical gaps in cultural history, Davis-Undiano considers important artifacts from the past and present, connecting the casta (caste) paintings of eighteenth-century Mexico to modern-day artists including John Valadez, Alma López, and Luis A. Jiménez Jr. He also examines such community celebrations as Day of the Dead, Cinco de Mayo, and lowrider car culture as examples of mestizo influence on mainstream American culture. Woven throughout is the search for meaning and understanding of mestizo identity. A large-scale landmark account of Mexican American culture, Mestizos Come Home! shows that mestizos are essential to U.S. national culture. As an argument for social justice and a renewal of America’s democratic ideals, this book marks a historic cultural homecoming.","9780806158075, 0806158077",False,True,337,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fk1jDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fk1jDgAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,University of Oklahoma Press

Most writing on cyberculture is dominated by two almost mutually exclusive visions: the heroic image of the male outlaw hacker and the utopian myth of a gender-free cyberworld. Reload offers an alternative picture of cyberspace as a complex and contradictory place where there is oppression as well as liberation. It shows how cyberpunk's revolutionary claims conceal its ultimate conservatism on matters of class, gender, and race. The cyberfeminists writing here view cyberculture as a social experiment with an as-yet-unfulfilled potential to create new identities, relationships, and cultures. The book brings together women's cyberfiction—fiction that explores the relationship between people and virtual technologies—and feminist theoretical and critical investigations of gender and technoculture. From a variety of viewpoints, the writers consider the effects of rapid and profound technological change on culture, in particular both the revolutionary and reactionary effects of cyberculture on women's lives. They also explore the feminist implications of the cyborg, a human-machine hybrid. The writers challenge the conceptual and institutional rifts between high and low culture, which are embedded in the texts and artifacts of cyberculture.","0262561506, 9780262561501",False,True,604,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2002,MIT Press

This study confirms the importance of considering presentation of discourse outside of literary fiction: popular science uses presented discourse in ways uncommon for fiction yet not conventional for non-fiction either. This analysis is an acknowledgement of the social consequences of popularization. Discourse presentation of scientists reconstructs the world of the scientific community as a human space but also projects back into it an image of the scientist the public wants to see. At the same time, Pilkington’s findings strengthen the view of popularization that rejects the notion of a strict divide between professional and popular science.","9789004365971, 9004365974",False,True,206,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P-t5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=P-t5DwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2018,BRILL

By focusing on two Asian American film festivals, this book analyzes the frames of memory that festivals create for their films, constructed through and circulated by the various festival media. It further establishes that festival locations—both cities and screening venues—play a significant role in shaping our experience of films. Finally, it shows that festivals produce performances which help guide audiences towards certain readings and direct the film’s role as a memory object. Bringing together film festival studies and memory studies, 'Asian American Film Festivals' offers a mixed-methods approach with which to explore the film festival phenomenon, thus shedding light on the complex dynamics of frames, locations, and performances shaping the festival’s memory practices. It also draws attention to the understudied genre of Asian American film festivals, showing how these festivals actively engage in constructing and performing a minority group’s collective identity and memory.","9783110696653, 3110696657",True,True,364,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z8gAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z8gAEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2020,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG

Why is this? Michael Austin asks, inUseful Fictions. Why, in particular, are human beings, whose very survival depends on obtaining true information, so drawn to fictional narratives? After all, virtually every human culture reveres some form of storytelling. Might there be an evolutionary reason behind our species' need for stories? Drawing on evolutionary biology, anthropology, narrative theory, cognitive psychology, game theory, and evolutionary aesthetics, Austin develops the concept of a ""useful fiction,"" a simple narrative that serves an adaptive function unrelated to its factual accuracy. In his work we see how these useful fictions play a key role in neutralizing the overwhelming anxiety that humans can experience as their minds gather and process information. Rudimentary narratives constructed for this purpose, Austin suggests, provided a cognitive scaffold that might have become the basis for our well-documented love of fictional stories. Written in clear, jargon-free prose and employing abundant literary examplesfrom the Bible toOne Thousand and One Arabian NightsandDon QuixotetoNo ExitAustin's work offers a new way of understanding the relationship between fiction and evolutionary processesand, perhaps, the very origins of literature.","9780803232976, 0803232977",True,True,193,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LKD7Kg94oEwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LKD7Kg94oEwC&source=gbs_api,2011,U of Nebraska Press
2ed1fc5c-d894-4989-b99c-723e58c21a51,fiction,Home Before Dark,A Novel,Riley Sager,"In the latest thriller from New York Times bestseller Riley Sager, a woman returns to the house made famous by her father’s bestselling horror memoir. Is the place really haunted by evil forces, as her father claimed? Or are there more earthbound—and dangerous—secrets hidden within its walls? What was it like? Living in that house. Maggie Holt is used to such questions. Twenty-five years ago, she and her parents, Ewan and Jess, moved into Baneberry Hall, a rambling Victorian estate in the Vermont woods. They spent three weeks there before fleeing in the dead of night, an ordeal Ewan later recounted in a nonfiction book called House of Horrors. His tale of ghostly happenings and encounters with malevolent spirits became a worldwide phenomenon, rivaling The Amityville Horror in popularity—and skepticism. Today, Maggie is a restorer of old homes and too young to remember any of the events mentioned in her father's book. But she also doesn’t believe a word of it. Ghosts, after all, don’t exist. When Maggie inherits Baneberry Hall after her father's death, she returns to renovate the place to prepare it for sale. But her homecoming is anything but warm. People from the past, chronicled in House of Horrors, lurk in the shadows. And locals aren’t thrilled that their small town has been made infamous thanks to Maggie’s father. Even more unnerving is Baneberry Hall itself—a place filled with relics from another era that hint at a history of dark deeds. As Maggie experiences strange occurrences straight out of her father’s book, she starts to believe that what he wrote was more fact than fiction.","9781524745189, 1524745189",True,False,402,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dda1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Dda1DwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2020,Penguin

28f87b74-aaa9-4f04-9f59-9764e41ecd75,fiction,Mestizos Come Home!,Making and Claiming Mexican American Identity,Robert Con Davis-Undiano,"Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano has described U.S. and Latin American culture as continually hobbled by amnesia—unable, or unwilling, to remember the influence of mestizos and indigenous populations. In Mestizos Come Home! author Robert Con Davis-Undiano documents the great awakening of Mexican American and Latino culture since the 1960s that has challenged this omission in collective memory. He maps a new awareness of the United States as intrinsically connected to the broader context of the Americas. At once native and new to the American Southwest, Mexican Americans have “come home” in a profound sense: they have reasserted their right to claim that land and U.S. culture as their own. Mestizos Come Home! explores key areas of change that Mexican Americans have brought to the United States. These areas include the recognition of mestizo identity, especially its historical development across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; the re-emergence of indigenous relationships to land; and the promotion of Mesoamerican conceptions of the human body. Clarifying and bridging critical gaps in cultural history, Davis-Undiano considers important artifacts from the past and present, connecting the casta (caste) paintings of eighteenth-century Mexico to modern-day artists including John Valadez, Alma López, and Luis A. Jiménez Jr. He also examines such community celebrations as Day of the Dead, Cinco de Mayo, and lowrider car culture as examples of mestizo influence on mainstream American culture. Woven throughout is the search for meaning and understanding of mestizo identity. A large-scale landmark account of Mexican American culture, Mestizos Come Home! shows that mestizos are essential to U.S. national culture. As an argument for social justice and a renewal of America’s democratic ideals, this book marks a historic cultural homecoming.","9780806158075, 0806158077",False,True,337,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fk1jDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fk1jDgAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,University of Oklahoma Press

Fourteen original case studies present material from late antiquity to the twenty-first century and explore these questions in a systematic manner. By coining the notion of ‘fictional practice’, the editors discuss the emergence of novel, imaginative types of magic from the nineteenth century onwards when fiction and practice came to be more and more intertwined or even fully amalgamated.

Most writing on cyberculture is dominated by two almost mutually exclusive visions: the heroic image of the male outlaw hacker and the utopian myth of a gender-free cyberworld. Reload offers an alternative picture of cyberspace as a complex and contradictory place where there is oppression as well as liberation. It shows how cyberpunk's revolutionary claims conceal its ultimate conservatism on matters of class, gender, and race. The cyberfeminists writing here view cyberculture as a social experiment with an as-yet-unfulfilled potential to create new identities, relationships, and cultures. The book brings together women's cyberfiction—fiction that explores the relationship between people and virtual technologies—and feminist theoretical and critical investigations of gender and technoculture. From a variety of viewpoints, the writers consider the effects of rapid and profound technological change on culture, in particular both the revolutionary and reactionary effects of cyberculture on women's lives. They also explore the feminist implications of the cyborg, a human-machine hybrid. The writers challenge the conceptual and institutional rifts between high and low culture, which are embedded in the texts and artifacts of cyberculture.","0262561506, 9780262561501",False,True,604,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2002,MIT Press

This study confirms the importance of considering presentation of discourse outside of literary fiction: popular science uses presented discourse in ways uncommon for fiction yet not conventional for non-fiction either. This analysis is an acknowledgement of the social consequences of popularization. Discourse presentation of scientists reconstructs the world of the scientific community as a human space but also projects back into it an image of the scientist the public wants to see.

By focusing on two Asian American film festivals, this book analyzes the frames of memory that festivals create for their films, constructed through and circulated by the various festival media. It further establishes that festival locations—both cities and screening venues—play a significant role in shaping our experience of films. Finally, it shows that festivals produce performances which help guide audiences towards certain readings and direct the film’s role as a memory object. Bringing together film festival studies and memory studies, 'Asian American Film Festivals' offers a mixed-methods approach with which to explore the film festival phenomenon, thus shedding light on the complex dynamics of frames, locations, and performances shaping the festival’s memory practices. It also draws attention to the understudied genre of Asian American film festivals, showing how these festivals actively engage in constructing and performing a minority group’s collective identity and memory.","9783110696653, 3110696657",True,True,364,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z8gAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z8gAEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2020,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG

One quarter of all American-produced Holocaust-related feature films have won or been nominated for at least one Oscar. In fact, from 1945 through 1991, half of all American Holocaust features were nominated. Yet most Holocaust movies have fallen through the cracks and few have been commercially successful. This book explores these trends--and many others--with a comprehensive guide to hundreds of films and made-for-television movies.

They are all of them on the fringes of London life, often clinging on – to sanity or solvency or a story – by their fingertips. Keith Ridgway, author of the acclaimed Hawthorn & Child, writes about people whose understanding of their own situation is only ever partial and fuzzy, who are consumed by emotions and anxieties and narratives, or the lack thereof, that they cannot master. He focuses on peripheral figures who mean well and to whom things happen, and happen confusingly, and his fictional strategies reflect this focus. In a deftly conjured high-wire act, Ridgway achieves the fine balance between the imperatives of drama and fidelity to his characters. The result is pin-sharp and often breathtaking.

139632c7-caf1-448d-b670-77ba778a8b22,fiction,Aesthetics and the Sciences of Mind,N/A,"Greg Currie, Matthew Kieran, Aaron Meskin, Jon Robson","Through much of the twentieth century, philosophical thinking about works of art, design, and other aesthetic products has emphasized intuitive and reflective methods, often tied to the idea that philosophy's business is primarily to analyze concepts. This 'philosophy from the armchair' approach contrasts with methods used by psychologists, sociologists, evolutionary thinkers, and others who study the making and reception of the arts empirically. How far should philosophers be sensitive to the results of these studies? Is their own largely a priori method basically flawed? Are their views on aesthetic value, interpretation, imagination, and the emotions of art to be rethought in the light of best science? The essays in this volume seek answers to these questions, many through detailed studies of problems traditionally regarded as philosophical but where empirical inquiry seems to be shedding interesting light. No common view is looked for or found in this volume: a number of authors argue that the current enthusiasm for scientific approaches to aesthetics is based on a misunderstanding of the philosophical enterprise and sometimes on misinterpretation of the science; others suggest various ways that philosophy can and should accommodate and sometimes yield to the empirical approach. The editors provide a substantial introduction which sets the scene historically and conceptually before summarizing the claims and arguments of the essays.","9780191648403, 019164840X",False,True,273,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5u78AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5u78AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2014,OUP Oxford

7aad9c72-43b8-44a8-9027-2685e83df75c,fiction,Idealism,New Essays in Metaphysics,"Tyron Goldschmidt, Kenneth L. Pearce","Idealism is a family of metaphysical views each of which gives priority to the mental. The best-known forms of idealism in Western philosophy are Berkeleyan idealism, which gives ontological priority to the mental (minds and ideas) over the physical (bodies), and Kantian idealism, which gives a kind of explanatory priority to the mental (the structure of the understanding) over the physical (the structure of the empirical world). Although idealism was once a dominant view in Western philosophy, it has suffered almost total neglect over the last several decades. This book rectifies this situation by bringing together seventeen essays by leading philosophers on the topic of metaphysical idealism. The various essays explain, attack, or defend a variety of idealistic theories, including not only Berkeleyan and Kantian idealisms but also those developed in traditions less familiar to analytic philosophers, including Buddhism and Hassidic Judaism. Although a number of the articles draw on historical sources, all will be of interest to philosophers working in contemporary metaphysics. This volume aims to spark a revival of serious philosophical interest in metaphysical idealism.","9780198746973, 0198746970",False,True,314,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j_pADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=j_pADwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,Oxford University Press

The current movement of people, knowledge and goods around the world has made intercultural communication both prevalent and indispensable. Consequently, the translator has become a more prominent figure and translation an increasingly present theme in works of literature. Embedding translation in a fictional setting and considering its most extreme forms – pseudotranslation or self-translation, for example – are fruitful ways of conceptualizing the act of translating and extending the boundaries of translation studies. Taken together, the various translational fictions examined in this collection yield new insights into questions of displacement, migration and hybridity, all characteristic of the modern world. The Fictions of Translation will thus be of interest to practising translators, students and scholars of translation and literary studies, as well as a more general readership.","9789027264510, 9027264511",True,True,319,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P0RJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P0RJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2018,John Benjamins Publishing Company

A decade ago, Maryanne Wolf’s Proust and the Squid revealed what we know about how the brain learns to read and how reading changes the way we think and feel. Since then, the ways we process written language have changed dramatically with many concerned about both their own changes and that of children. New research on the reading brain chronicles these changes in the brains of children and adults as they learn to read while immersed in a digitally dominated medium. Drawing deeply on this research, this book comprises a series of letters Wolf writes to us—her beloved readers—to describe her concerns and her hopes about what is happening to the reading brain as it unavoidably changes to adapt to digital mediums. Wolf raises difficult questions, including: Will children learn to incorporate the full range of ""deep reading"" processes that are at the core of the expert reading brain? Will the mix of a seemingly infinite set of distractions for children’s attention and their quick access to immediate, voluminous information alter their ability to think for themselves? With information at their fingertips, will the next generation learn to build their own storehouse of knowledge, which could impede the ability to make analogies and draw inferences from what they know? Will all these influences change the formation in children and the use in adults of ""slower"" cognitive processes like critical thinking, personal reflection, imagination, and empathy that comprise deep reading and that influence both how we think and how we live our lives? How can we preserve deep reading processes in future iterations of the reading brain? Concerns about attention span, critical reasoning, and over-reliance on technology are never just about children—Wolf herself has found that, though she is a reading expert, her ability to read deeply has been impacted as she has become increasingly dependent on screens. Wolf draws on neuroscience, literature, education, and philosophy and blends historical, literary, and scientific facts with down-to-earth examples and warm anecdotes to illuminate complex ideas that culminate in a proposal for a biliterate reading brain. Provocative and intriguing, Reader, Come Home is a roadmap that provides a cautionary but hopeful perspective on the impact of technology on our brains and our most essential intellectual capacities—and what this could mean for our future.","9780062388797, 0062388797",True,False,233,Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hlg_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2,3,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hlg_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2018,HarperCollins

She’s studied hard, made her Filipino immigrant parents proud and is ready to reap the rewards in the form of a full college scholarship to the school of her dreams. And then everything shatters. Her parents are forced to reveal the truth: their visas expired years ago. Her entire family is illegal. That means no scholarships, maybe no college at all and the very real threat of deportation. As she’s trying to make sense of this new reality, her world is turned upside down again by Royce Blakely.

22f46e97-3a13-409d-b357-91309cab9cbc,fiction,Mestizos Come Home!,Making and Claiming Mexican American Identity,Robert Con Davis-Undiano,"Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano has described U.S. and Latin American culture as continually hobbled by amnesia—unable, or unwilling, to remember the influence of mestizos and indigenous populations. In Mestizos Come Home! author Robert Con Davis-Undiano documents the great awakening of Mexican American and Latino culture since the 1960s that has challenged this omission in collective memory. He maps a new awareness of the United States as intrinsically connected to the broader context of the Americas. At once native and new to the American Southwest, Mexican Americans have “come home” in a profound sense: they have reasserted their right to claim that land and U.S. culture as their own. Mestizos Come Home! explores key areas of change that Mexican Americans have brought to the United States. These areas include the recognition of mestizo identity, especially its historical development across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; the re-emergence of indigenous relationships to land; and the promotion of Mesoamerican conceptions of the human body. Clarifying and bridging critical gaps in cultural history, Davis-Undiano considers important artifacts from the past and present, connecting the casta (caste) paintings of eighteenth-century Mexico to modern-day artists including John Valadez, Alma López, and Luis A. Jiménez Jr. He also examines such community celebrations as Day of the Dead, Cinco de Mayo, and lowrider car culture as examples of mestizo influence on mainstream American culture. Woven throughout is the search for meaning and understanding of mestizo identity. A large-scale landmark account of Mexican American culture, Mestizos Come Home! shows that mestizos are essential to U.S. national culture. As an argument for social justice and a renewal of America’s democratic ideals, this book marks a historic cultural homecoming.","9780806158075, 0806158077",False,True,337,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fk1jDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fk1jDgAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,University of Oklahoma Press

In a deftly conjured high-wire act, Ridgway achieves the fine balance between the imperatives of drama and fidelity to his characters. The result is pin-sharp and often breathtaking.

Most writing on cyberculture is dominated by two almost mutually exclusive visions: the heroic image of the male outlaw hacker and the utopian myth of a gender-free cyberworld. Reload offers an alternative picture of cyberspace as a complex and contradictory place where there is oppression as well as liberation. It shows how cyberpunk's revolutionary claims conceal its ultimate conservatism on matters of class, gender, and race. The cyberfeminists writing here view cyberculture as a social experiment with an as-yet-unfulfilled potential to create new identities, relationships, and cultures. The book brings together women's cyberfiction—fiction that explores the relationship between people and virtual technologies—and feminist theoretical and critical investigations of gender and technoculture. From a variety of viewpoints, the writers consider the effects of rapid and profound technological change on culture, in particular both the revolutionary and reactionary effects of cyberculture on women's lives. They also explore the feminist implications of the cyborg, a human-machine hybrid. The writers challenge the conceptual and institutional rifts between high and low culture, which are embedded in the texts and artifacts of cyberculture.","0262561506, 9780262561501",False,True,604,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8LFsPwN2AJIC&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2002,MIT Press

Pilkington explores the forms and functions of the voices of scientists in books written for non-professionals. This study confirms the importance of considering presentation of discourse outside of literary fiction: popular science uses presented discourse in ways uncommon for fiction yet not conventional for non-fiction either. This analysis is an acknowledgement of the social consequences of popularization. Discourse presentation of scientists reconstructs the world of the scientific community as a human space but also projects back into it an image of the scientist the public wants to see. At the same time, Pilkington’s findings strengthen the view of popularization that rejects the notion of a strict divide between professional and popular science.","9789004365971, 9004365974",False,True,206,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P-t5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=P-t5DwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2018,BRILL

By focusing on two Asian American film festivals, this book analyzes the frames of memory that festivals create for their films, constructed through and circulated by the various festival media. It further establishes that festival locations—both cities and screening venues—play a significant role in shaping our experience of films. Finally, it shows that festivals produce performances which help guide audiences towards certain readings and direct the film’s role as a memory object. Bringing together film festival studies and memory studies, 'Asian American Film Festivals' offers a mixed-methods approach with which to explore the film festival phenomenon, thus shedding light on the complex dynamics of frames, locations, and performances shaping the festival’s memory practices. It also draws attention to the understudied genre of Asian American film festivals, showing how these festivals actively engage in constructing and performing a minority group’s collective identity and memory.","9783110696653, 3110696657",True,True,364,Social Science,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z8gAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z8gAEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2020,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG

One quarter of all American-produced Holocaust-related feature films have won or been nominated for at least one Oscar. In fact, from 1945 through 1991, half of all American Holocaust features were nominated. Yet most Holocaust movies have fallen through the cracks and few have been commercially successful. This book explores these trends--and many others--with a comprehensive guide to hundreds of films and made-for-television movies. From Anne Frank to Schindler's List to Jojo Rabbit, more than 400 films are examined from a range of perspectives--historical, chronological, thematic, sociological, geographical and individual. The filmmakers are contextualized, including Charlie Chaplin, Sidney Lumet, Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino and Roman Polanski. Recommendations and reviews of the 50 best Holocaust films are included, along with an educational guide, a detailed listing of all films covered and a four-part index-glossary.","9781476641928, 1476641927",True,True,489,Performing Arts,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JJdDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JJdDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2021,McFarland

64f026f7-9ac6-4d81-837d-fb6a582386c6,fiction,Aesthetics and the Sciences of Mind,N/A,"Greg Currie, Matthew Kieran, Aaron Meskin, Jon Robson","Through much of the twentieth century, philosophical thinking about works of art, design, and other aesthetic products has emphasized intuitive and reflective methods, often tied to the idea that philosophy's business is primarily to analyze concepts. This 'philosophy from the armchair' approach contrasts with methods used by psychologists, sociologists, evolutionary thinkers, and others who study the making and reception of the arts empirically. How far should philosophers be sensitive to the results of these studies? Is their own largely a priori method basically flawed? Are their views on aesthetic value, interpretation, imagination, and the emotions of art to be rethought in the light of best science? The essays in this volume seek answers to these questions, many through detailed studies of problems traditionally regarded as philosophical but where empirical inquiry seems to be shedding interesting light. No common view is looked for or found in this volume: a number of authors argue that the current enthusiasm for scientific approaches to aesthetics is based on a misunderstanding of the philosophical enterprise and sometimes on misinterpretation of the science; others suggest various ways that philosophy can and should accommodate and sometimes yield to the empirical approach. The editors provide a substantial introduction which sets the scene historically and conceptually before summarizing the claims and arguments of the essays.","9780191648403, 019164840X",False,True,273,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5u78AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5u78AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2014,OUP Oxford

The current movement of people, knowledge and goods around the world has made intercultural communication both prevalent and indispensable. Consequently, the translator has become a more prominent figure and translation an increasingly present theme in works of literature. Embedding translation in a fictional setting and considering its most extreme forms – pseudotranslation or self-translation, for example – are fruitful ways of conceptualizing the act of translating and extending the boundaries of translation studies. Taken together, the various translational fictions examined in this collection yield new insights into questions of displacement, migration and hybridity, all characteristic of the modern world. The Fictions of Translation will thus be of interest to practising translators, students and scholars of translation and literary studies, as well as a more general readership.","9789027264510, 9027264511",True,True,319,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P0RJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P0RJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2018,John Benjamins Publishing Company

Since its beginnings, tourism has inspired themed built environments that have a constitutive, and sometimes problematic, relationship with the “real” world and its architectural references. This volume questions and rethinks the different environments constructed or adapted both for and by tourism exploring the relationship between the “real” and the “unreal” within the tourist bubble and the ways in which the real world inspires simulacra for tourism use. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach this book touches on a wide range of geographical areas, eras and subjects such as post-socialist tourism in Poland, the Hawaiian imaginary in Las Vegas, Rio de Janeiro’s Little Africa, as well as multiple instances of virtual reality in tourism.

In early twentieth-century New York, poisons offered an easy path to the perfect crime. Science had no place in the Tammany Hall-controlled coroner's office, and corruption ran rampant. However, with the appointment of chief medical examiner Charles Norris in 1918, the poison game changed forever. Together with toxicologist Alexander Gettler, the duo set the justice system on fire with their trailblazing scientific detective work, triumphing over seemingly unbeatable odds to become the pioneers of forensic chemistry and the gatekeepers of justice.

2bc2bd0d-6e82-4693-866e-5241b3613507,fiction,Creating Identity in the Victorian Fictional Autobiography,N/A,Heidi L. Pennington,"This is the first book-length study of the fictional autobiography, a subgenre that is at once widely recognizable and rarely examined as a literary form with its own history and dynamics of interpretation. Heidi L. Pennington shows that the narrative form and genre expectations associated with the fictional autobiography in the Victorian period engages readers in a sustained meditation on the fictional processes that construct selfhood both in and beyond the text. Through close readings of Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, and other well-known examples of the subgenre, Pennington shows how the Victorian fictional autobiography subtly but persistently illustrates that all identities are fictions. Despite the subgenre’s radical implications regarding the nature of personal identity, fictional autobiographies were popular in their own time and continue to inspire devotion in readers. This study sheds new light on what makes this subgenre so compelling, up to and including in the present historical moment of precipitous social and technological change. As we continue to grapple with the existential question of what determines “who we really are,” this book explores the risks and rewards of embracing conscious acts of fictional self-production in an unstable world.","9780826274069, 0826274064",True,True,240,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mEBIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mEBIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2018,University of Missouri Press

These models distinguish between qualitatively different modes of information processing in making decisions and solving problems (e.g., associative versus rule-based, controlled versus uncontrolled, and affective versus cognitive modes). Leading contributors review the basic assumptions of these approaches and review the ways they have been applied and tested in such areas as attitudes, stereotyping, person perception, memory, and judgment. Also examined are the relationships between different sets of processing modes, the factors that determine their utilization, and how they work in combination to affect responses to social information.","1572304219, 9781572304215",False,False,676,Psychology,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5X_auIBx99EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,3,2,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5X_auIBx99EC&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,1999,Guilford Press

f488dc7d-6428-4c3f-acad-c60b66e35883,fiction,Idealism,New Essays in Metaphysics,"Tyron Goldschmidt, Kenneth L. Pearce","Idealism is a family of metaphysical views each of which gives priority to the mental. The best-known forms of idealism in Western philosophy are Berkeleyan idealism, which gives ontological priority to the mental (minds and ideas) over the physical (bodies), and Kantian idealism, which gives a kind of explanatory priority to the mental (the structure of the understanding) over the physical (the structure of the empirical world). Although idealism was once a dominant view in Western philosophy, it has suffered almost total neglect over the last several decades. This book rectifies this situation by bringing together seventeen essays by leading philosophers on the topic of metaphysical idealism. The various essays explain, attack, or defend a variety of idealistic theories, including not only Berkeleyan and Kantian idealisms but also those developed in traditions less familiar to analytic philosophers, including Buddhism and Hassidic Judaism. Although a number of the articles draw on historical sources, all will be of interest to philosophers working in contemporary metaphysics. This volume aims to spark a revival of serious philosophical interest in metaphysical idealism.","9780198746973, 0198746970",False,True,314,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j_pADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=j_pADwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,Oxford University Press

Drawing parallels between a precarious journey across Ladakh and Life, the author has shown that it is 'uncertainty' from which the evils of fear and lethargy emanates, that stop us from listening to our true calling. Taking cues from his own struggle and journey, the author explains the need for experiential learning in our lives; how we can balance rational and intuitive thinking, and goes deep into the values of love, creativity, entrepreneurship and the concept of risk that is associated with it. 'When the Road Beckons' is a remarkable story of a metamorphic motorcycle journey that leads to self discovery.

The current movement of people, knowledge and goods around the world has made intercultural communication both prevalent and indispensable. Consequently, the translator has become a more prominent figure and translation an increasingly present theme in works of literature. Embedding translation in a fictional setting and considering its most extreme forms – pseudotranslation or self-translation, for example – are fruitful ways of conceptualizing the act of translating and extending the boundaries of translation studies. Taken together, the various translational fictions examined in this collection yield new insights into questions of displacement, migration and hybridity, all characteristic of the modern world. The Fictions of Translation will thus be of interest to practising translators, students and scholars of translation and literary studies, as well as a more general readership.","9789027264510, 9027264511",True,True,319,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P0RJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P0RJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2018,John Benjamins Publishing Company

Thompson True to both life and legend, Legs brilliantly evokes the flamboyant career of gangster Jack “Legs” Diamond. Through the equivocal eyes of Diamond’s attorney, Marcus Gorman (who scraps a promising political career for the more elemental excitement of the criminal underworld), we watch as Legs and his showgirl mistress, Kiki Roberts, blaze their gaudy trail across the tabloid pages of the 1920s and 1930s. William Kennedy’s Albany Cycle of novels reflect what he once described as the fusion of his imagination with a single place. A native and longtime resident of Albany, New York, his work moves from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, chronicling family life, the city’s netherworld, and its spheres of power—financial, ethnic, political—often among the Irish-Americans who dominated the city in this period.

These interviews do more than just define an innovative genre of contemporary fiction. They provide a precise way of understanding the complicated relationship and pregnant tensions between contextualized thinking and historical representation, interdisciplinary studies and 'truth' production, and fictional reality and factual constructions.

But Holly is no typical teenage runaway: A sensitive child once contacted by voices she knew only as “the radio people,” Holly is a lightning rod for psychic phenomena. Now, as she wanders deeper into the English countryside, visions and coincidences reorder her reality until they assume the aura of a nightmare brought to life. For Holly has caught the attention of a cabal of dangerous mystics—and their enemies. But her lost weekend is merely the prelude to a shocking disappearance that leaves her family irrevocably scarred. This unsolved mystery will echo through every decade of Holly’s life, affecting all the people Holly loves—even the ones who are not yet born. A Cambridge scholarship boy grooming himself for wealth and influence, a conflicted father who feels alive only while reporting on the war in Iraq, a middle-aged writer mourning his exile from the bestseller list—all have a part to play in this surreal, invisible war on the margins of our world. From the medieval Swiss Alps to the nineteenth-century Australian bush, from a hotel in Shanghai to a Manhattan townhouse in the near future, their stories come together in moments of everyday grace and extraordinary wonder. Rich with character and realms of possibility, The Bone Clocks is a kaleidoscopic novel that begs to be taken apart and put back together by a writer The Washington Post calls “the novelist who’s been showing us the future of fiction.” An elegant conjurer of interconnected tales, a genre-bending daredevil, and a master prose stylist, David Mitchell has become one of the leading literary voices of his generation. His hypnotic new novel, The Bone Clocks, crackles with invention and wit and sheer storytelling pleasure—it is fiction at its most spellbinding. Named to more than 20 year-end best of lists, including NPR • San Francisco Chronicle • The Atlantic • The Guardian • Slate • BuzzFeed “One of the most entertaining and thrilling novels I’ve read in a long time.”—Meg Wolitzer, NPR “[Mitchell] writes with a furious intensity and slapped-awake vitality, with a delight in language and all the rabbit holes of experience.”—The New York Times Book Review “Intensely compelling . . . fantastically witty . . . offers up a rich selection of domestic realism, gothic fantasy and apocalyptic speculation.”—The Washington Post “[A] time-traveling, culture-crossing, genre-bending marvel of a novel.”—O: The Oprah Magazine “Great fun . . . a tour de force . . .

However, with the appointment of chief medical examiner Charles Norris in 1918, the poison game changed forever. Together with toxicologist Alexander Gettler, the duo set the justice system on fire with their trailblazing scientific detective work, triumphing over seemingly unbeatable odds to become the pioneers of forensic chemistry and the gatekeepers of justice.

dffbf2e7-7b86-4f0b-ab6f-780ed1eb9de1,fiction,The Laughing Monsters,N/A,Denis Johnson,"Roland Nair calls himself Scandinavian but travels on a U.S. passport. After ten years’ absence, he returns to Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, to reunite with his friend Michael Adriko. They once made a lot of money here during the country’s civil war, and, curious to see whether good luck will strike twice in the same place, Nair allows himself to be drawn back to a region he considers hopeless. Adriko is an African who styles himself a soldier of fortune and who claims to have served, at various times, the Ghanaian Army, the Kuwaiti Emiri Guard, and the American Green Berets. He’s probably broke now, but he remains, at thirty-six, as stirred by his own doubtful schemes as he was a decade ago. Although Nair believes some kind of money-making plan lies at the back of it all, Michael’s stated reason for inviting his friend to Freetown is that Nair should meet Michael’s fiancee, a college girl named Davidia from Colorado. Together the three set out to visit Michael’s clan in the Uganda-Congo borderland—but each of these travellers is keeping secrets from the others. Shadowed by Interpol, the Mossad, and MI-6, Nair gets mired in lust and betrayal in a landscape of frighteningly casual violence as he travels with Adriko and Davidia, gets smuggled into a war zone, kidnapped by the Congo Army, and terrorized by a self-proclaimed god ruling over a dying village. Their journey through a land abandoned by the future leads Adriko, Nair and Davidia to meet themselves not in a new light, but rather in a new darkness. A high-suspense tale of kaleidoscoping loyalties in the post-9/11 world, The Laughing Monsters shows one of our great novelists at the top of his game.","9781443438018, 1443438014",True,False,175,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u36BAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,1,4,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=u36BAwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2014,Harper Collins

In early twentieth-century New York, poisons offered an easy path to the perfect crime. Science had no place in the Tammany Hall-controlled coroner's office, and corruption ran rampant. However, with the appointment of chief medical examiner Charles Norris in 1918, the poison game changed forever. Together with toxicologist Alexander Gettler, the duo set the justice system on fire with their trailblazing scientific detective work, triumphing over seemingly unbeatable odds to become the pioneers of forensic chemistry and the gatekeepers of justice.

Sassy and irreverent from the get-go, Daisy Fay takes us on a rollicking journey through her formative years on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. There, at The End of the Road of the South, the family malt shop freezer holds unspeakable things, society maven Mrs. Dot hosts Junior Debutante meetings and shares inspired thoughts for the week (such as “sincerity is as valuable as radium”), and Daisy Fay’s Daddy hatches a quick-cash scheme that involves resurrecting his daughter from the dead in a carefully orchestrated miracle. Along the way, Daisy Fay does a lot of growing up, emerging as one of the most hilarious, appealing, and prized characters in modern fiction.

6549df72-e3cb-482e-9d02-f782c9fe7ff7,fiction,Creating Identity in the Victorian Fictional Autobiography,N/A,Heidi L. Pennington,"This is the first book-length study of the fictional autobiography, a subgenre that is at once widely recognizable and rarely examined as a literary form with its own history and dynamics of interpretation. Heidi L. Pennington shows that the narrative form and genre expectations associated with the fictional autobiography in the Victorian period engages readers in a sustained meditation on the fictional processes that construct selfhood both in and beyond the text. Through close readings of Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, and other well-known examples of the subgenre, Pennington shows how the Victorian fictional autobiography subtly but persistently illustrates that all identities are fictions. Despite the subgenre’s radical implications regarding the nature of personal identity, fictional autobiographies were popular in their own time and continue to inspire devotion in readers. This study sheds new light on what makes this subgenre so compelling, up to and including in the present historical moment of precipitous social and technological change. As we continue to grapple with the existential question of what determines “who we really are,” this book explores the risks and rewards of embracing conscious acts of fictional self-production in an unstable world.","9780826274069, 0826274064",True,True,240,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mEBIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mEBIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2018,University of Missouri Press

Clara has never known another home. In fact, she's confined to the grand estate due to a mysterious heart condition. But it's a comfortable life, and if it weren't for the creepy squawking birds in the aviary out back, a completely peaceful one too. But once old Mrs. Glendoveer passes away, Clara comes to learn many dark secrets about the family. The Glendoveers suffered a horrific tragedy: their children were kidnapped, then drowned. And their father George Glendoveer, a famous magician and illusionist, stood accused until his death. As Clara digs deeper and deeper into the terrifying events, the five birds in the aviary seem to be trying to tell her something. And Clara comes to wonder: what is their true identity? Clara sets out to solve a decades-old murder mystery—and in doing so, unlocks a secret in her own life, too.

Might this be the moment she finally feels she can understand him? An electrifying new voice from contemporary Syria on life in a climate of fear Suleima and Nassim first meet in their therapist’s tiny waiting room in Damascus. In the city’s atmosphere of surveillance and anxiety, they begin a tenuous relationship. Some years later, after civil war breaks out, Nassim leaves Syria for Germany. He doesn’t ask Suleima to come with him; instead, from thousands of miles away, he sends her a book he has written, a novel about a woman whose experiences are very close to her own. As Suleima reads, her past overwhelms her. Time begins to fold in on itself, her sense of identity unravels, she has no idea what to trust – Naseem’s pages, her own memory – both – or neither? As she attempts to solve the mystery of her lover’s manuscript, she must confront what has happened to her family, to her country, and start to make sense of who she is and what she has become. Bold, contemporary, and told with captivating immediacy, The Frightened Ones is an intimate reckoning of living with fear from an electrifying new voice.","9781784707996, 1784707996",True,False,0,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_umQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_umQEAAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2021,National Geographic Books

When a man is found on a British beach, drifting in and out of consciousness, with no identification and unable to speak, interest in him is sparked immediately. From the hospital staff who find themselves inexplicably drawn to him, to international medical experts who are baffled by him, to the national press who call him Mr. Nobody, everyone wants answers. Who is this man? And what happened to him? Some memories are best forgotten. Neuropsychiatrist Dr. Emma Lewis is asked to assess the patient in a small town deep in the English countryside. This is her field of expertise, this is the chance she’s been waiting for, and this case could make her name known across the world. But therein lies the danger. Emma left this same town fourteen years ago and has taken great pains to cover all traces of her past since then. Places aren't haunted . . . people are. But now something—or someone—is calling her back. And the more time she spends with her patient, the more alarmed she becomes that he knows the one thing about her that nobody is supposed to know.","9780593159484, 0593159489",False,False,433,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nNYwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nNYwEAAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2021,Ballantine Books

Simpson, longtime co-editor of The Southern Review and an established authority on Southern literature. The two long conversations with Professor Simpson place the post World War II Southern novel in the context of modern literature and of the classical Southern novel. Professor Simpson, who knew many of the giants of Southern literature, assesses the writers of the past and the possibilities of the future.

8335c6f2-5075-4e31-9768-610fcecfbce9,fiction,Dying Planet,Mars in Science and the Imagination,Robert Markley,"For more than a century, Mars has been at the center of debates about humanity’s place in the cosmos. Focusing on perceptions of the red planet in scientific works and science fiction, Dying Planet analyzes the ways Mars has served as a screen onto which humankind has projected both its hopes for the future and its fears of ecological devastation on Earth. Robert Markley draws on planetary astronomy, the history and cultural study of science, science fiction, literary and cultural criticism, ecology, and astrobiology to offer a cross-disciplinary investigation of the cultural and scientific dynamics that have kept Mars on front pages since the 1800s. Markley interweaves chapters on science and science fiction, enabling him to illuminate each arena and to explore the ways their concerns overlap and influence one another. He tracks all the major scientific developments, from observations through primitive telescopes in the seventeenth century to data returned by the rovers that landed on Mars in 2004. Markley describes how major science fiction writers—H. G. Wells, Kim Stanley Robinson, Philip K. Dick, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, and Judith Merril—responded to new theories and new controversies. He also considers representations of Mars in film, on the radio, and in the popular press. In its comprehensive study of both science and science fiction, Dying Planet reveals how changing conceptions of Mars have had crucial consequences for understanding ecology on Earth.",UOM:39015062570315,False,False,464,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cLJlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cLJlAAAAMAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2005,Duke University Press Books

It also illuminates the past and present of crime fiction in various supranational regions across the world, including East and South Asia, the Arab World, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and Scandinavia, as well as three spheres defined by a shared language, namely the Francophone, Lusophone, and Hispanic worlds. Thoroughly-researched and broad in scope, this book is as valuable for general readers as for undergraduate and postgraduate students of popular fiction and world literature.","1108723357, 9781108723350",False,False,320,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b0HfzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=b0HfzgEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2022,Cambridge University Press

Coetzee's latest novel, The Schooldays of Jesus, is now available from Viking. Late Essays: 2006-2016 will be available January 2018. Nobel Prize-winning author J. M. Coetzee's new book follows a young biographer as he works on a book about the late writer, John Coetzee. The biographer embarks on a series of interviews with people who were important to Coetzee during the period when he was ""finding his feet as a writer""-in his thirties and sharing a run-down cottage in the suburbs of Cape Town with his widowed father. Their testimonies create an image of an awkward, reserved, and bookish young man who finds it difficult to connect with the people around him. An innovative and inspired work of fiction-incisive, elegant, and often surprisingly funny- Summertime allows one of the most revered writers of our time to imagine his own life with a critical and unsparing eye.","9780143118459, 0143118455",True,False,0,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AamMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AamMEAAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2010,National Geographic Books

Demonstrating its capabilities, the Time Traveller embarks on a journey to the distant future, arriving in the year 802,701. He discovers a seemingly utopian society inhabited by the gentle Eloi, but soon uncovers a dark and terrifying underworld ruled by the sinister Morlocks. As the Time Traveller delves deeper into this bifurcated world, he realises the grim consequences of societal decay and the potential fate of humanity. H.G. Wells’ The Time Machine is a pioneering work in the science fiction genre, introducing the concept of time travel and coining the term »time machine«. First published in 1895, it has since become a classic, influencing countless works of fiction and shaping the genre’s development. H. G. WELLS [1866-1946] was a British author and pioneer in the science fiction genre. His works, including The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds, delved into futuristic and societal critique themes. Wells’s visionary portrayals of technology, social structures, and extraterrestrial life made him one of the most influential writers in his field and a precursor to modern science fiction.","9789180949316, 9180949312",True,True,82,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bQ4LEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bQ4LEQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2024,Modernista

2657cfd2-1709-47e6-8c72-46e064156f64,fiction,European Readings of American Popular Culture,N/A,"John R. Dean, Jean-Paul Gabilliet","Since the Second World War, Europe has undergone a continual invasion: wave after wave of American popular culture. The diffusion of American culture in Europe is both a European story about America and an American story about Europe. This work examines this cross-cultural phenomenon from the European viewpoint. Nearly two dozen European experts in their respective fields offer an invigorating, engaging, and open-minded examination of America as perceived with the acute insight of the interested European outsider—a fruitful tradition that stretches back to Lafayette, de Tocqueville, and Goethe, to name three. Of interest to scholars, students, and general readers alike. The book's focus is both sensuous and intellectual: how America is seen (The Image); heard (Popular Music); perused (The Written Word); digested (Food); learned from its common ways (Social Customs); perceived by minorities (Ethnic Cultures); and taken as an instrument of change (Americanization). It is the first book of its kind published in the United States. It is rich with selected, up-to-date critical bibliographies in areas for which very little information is otherwise available. In sum: a cogent, cross-cultural analysis of how U.S. popular culture exposes both European dreams of well-being and nightmares of discontent. These are insights which deserve to be savored.",UOM:39015037411538,False,False,296,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vIJGAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vIJGAAAAMAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,1996,Praeger

Offering a lucid account of the major theoretical issues and comparative perspectives that constitute world crime fiction, this book introduces readers to the international crime fiction publishing industry, the translation and circulation of crime fiction, international crime fiction collections, the role of women in world crime fiction, and regional forms of crime fiction. It also illuminates the past and present of crime fiction in various supranational regions across the world, including East and South Asia, the Arab World, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and Scandinavia, as well as three spheres defined by a shared language, namely the Francophone, Lusophone, and Hispanic worlds. Thoroughly-researched and broad in scope, this book is as valuable for general readers as for undergraduate and postgraduate students of popular fiction and world literature.","1108723357, 9781108723350",False,False,320,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b0HfzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=b0HfzgEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2022,Cambridge University Press

Coetzee's latest novel, The Schooldays of Jesus, is now available from Viking. Late Essays: 2006-2016 will be available January 2018. Nobel Prize-winning author J. M. Coetzee's new book follows a young biographer as he works on a book about the late writer, John Coetzee. The biographer embarks on a series of interviews with people who were important to Coetzee during the period when he was ""finding his feet as a writer""-in his thirties and sharing a run-down cottage in the suburbs of Cape Town with his widowed father. Their testimonies create an image of an awkward, reserved, and bookish young man who finds it difficult to connect with the people around him. An innovative and inspired work of fiction-incisive, elegant, and often surprisingly funny- Summertime allows one of the most revered writers of our time to imagine his own life with a critical and unsparing eye.","9780143118459, 0143118455",True,False,0,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AamMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AamMEAAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2010,National Geographic Books

Demonstrating its capabilities, the Time Traveller embarks on a journey to the distant future, arriving in the year 802,701. He discovers a seemingly utopian society inhabited by the gentle Eloi, but soon uncovers a dark and terrifying underworld ruled by the sinister Morlocks. As the Time Traveller delves deeper into this bifurcated world, he realises the grim consequences of societal decay and the potential fate of humanity. H.G. Wells’ The Time Machine is a pioneering work in the science fiction genre, introducing the concept of time travel and coining the term »time machine«. First published in 1895, it has since become a classic, influencing countless works of fiction and shaping the genre’s development. H. G. WELLS [1866-1946] was a British author and pioneer in the science fiction genre. His works, including The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds, delved into futuristic and societal critique themes. Wells’s visionary portrayals of technology, social structures, and extraterrestrial life made him one of the most influential writers in his field and a precursor to modern science fiction.","9789180949316, 9180949312",True,True,82,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bQ4LEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bQ4LEQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2024,Modernista

b6a51ac5-11a2-4bda-96ed-c61d5f60dee8,fiction,Holiday Romance,N/A,Charles Dickens,"Holiday Romance is a short story by Charles Dickens. Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 - 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's most memorable fictional characters and is generally regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian period. During his life, his works enjoyed unprecedented fame, and by the twentieth century his literary genius was broadly acknowledged by critics and scholars. His novels and short stories continue to be widely popular. Born in Portsmouth, England, Dickens was forced to leave school to work in a factory when his father was thrown into debtors' prison. Although he had little formal education, his early impoverishment drove him to succeed. Over his career he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas and hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms. Dickens sprang to fame with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly installments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback. For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens went on to improve the character with positive features.","1484179412, 9781484179413",False,False,72,Literary Collections,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VN18oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VN18oAEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2013,CreateSpace

bc7b8fe3-88f5-4784-b5c0-44dd14a76292,fiction,Look at the Birdie,Short Fiction,Kurt Vonnegut,"“Relentlessly fun to read.”—Dave Eggers • A collection of fourteen previously unpublished short stories from one of the most original writers in all of American fiction In this series of perfectly rendered vignettes, written just as he was starting to find his comic voice, Kurt Vonnegut paints a warm, wise, and funny portrait of life in post–World War II America—a world where squabbling couples, high school geniuses, misfit office workers, and small-town lotharios struggle to adapt to changing technology, moral ambiguity, and unprecedented affluence. Here are tales both cautionary and hopeful, each brimming with Vonnegut’s trademark humor and profound humanism. A family learns the downside of confiding their deepest secrets into a magical invention. A man finds himself in a Kafkaesque world of trouble after he runs afoul of the shady underworld boss who calls the shots in an upstate New York town. A quack psychiatrist turned “murder counselor” concocts a novel new outlet for his paranoid patients. While these stories reflect the anxieties of the postwar era that Vonnegut was so adept at capturing—and provide insight into the development of his early style—collectively, they have a timeless quality that makes them just as relevant today as when they were written. It’s impossible to imagine any of these pieces flowing from the pen of another writer; each in its own way is unmistakably, quintessentially Vonnegut. Featuring a foreword by author and longtime Vonnegut confidant Sidney Offit and illustrated with Vonnegut’s characteristically insouciant line drawings, Look at the Birdie is an unexpected gift for readers who thought his unique voice had been stilled forever—and serves as a terrific introduction to his short fiction for anyone who has yet to experience his genius. Includes these never-before-published stories: “Confido” “FUBAR” “Shout About It from the Housetops” “Ed Luby’s Key Club” “A Song for Selma” “Hall of Mirrors” “The Nice Little People” “Hello, Red” “Little Drops of Water” “The Petrified Ants” “The Honor of a Newsboy” “Look at the Birdie” “King and Queen of the Universe” “The Good Explainer” “[Look at the Birdie] brings us the late writer’s young voice as he skewers—sometimes gently, always lethally—post World War II America.”—The Boston Globe","9780385343725, 0385343728",False,False,274,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l3-XTkaEqAkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=l3-XTkaEqAkC&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2010,Dial Press Trade Paperback

54cf5876-0cb2-4fc9-9006-62375d45915d,fiction,Narrative Framing in Contemporary American Novels,Twice-Mediated Fiction,Sławomir Studniarz,"This volume examines a range of novels and novellas published over the course of nearly forty years, from 1968 to 2014, including E.L. Doctorow’s Andrew’s Brain, John Gardner’s “The King’s Indian,” Paul Auster’s Travels in the Scriptorium, Peter Straub’s Mr. X, and Joyce Carol Oates’ Expensive People. These texts display one crucial unifying thread: they are doubly-mediated fictions, fictions in parentheses, so to speak. The application of narrative framing and embedding has been commonly acknowledged and abundantly researched in various works belonging to the Western literary heritage. However, its use in the twentieth and twenty-first century fiction has not been adequately explored, perhaps with the exception of the literary creations of such giants as Vladimir Nabokov and John Barth. Despite this critical oversight, narrative frames prove to be a major resource for modern-day novelists, who adapt this literary device and very effectively put it to their own uses. The essays collected in this volume will serve to spark the revival of interest in this time-honored narrative tool, demonstrating its validity for research into more recently created novels.","9781443893312, 1443893315",False,True,192,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jG3XDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jG3XDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2017,Cambridge Scholars Publishing

bbb583cc-a0dd-4e80-9add-b11ca811aef0,fiction,The Edge of the Fall,A Novel,Kate Williams,"An utterly spellbinding novel of the 1920s in London and Paris, The Edge of the Fall is bestselling author Kate Williams’s follow-up to her beloved and universally praised novel The Storms of War. In the aftermath of the Great War, the de Witt family is struggling to piece together the shattered fragments of their lives. Stoneythorpe Hall has become an empty shell with no servants to ensure its upkeep. Rudolf and his wife, Verena, still reeling from the loss of their second son, don’t know how to function in the post-war world. Eldest son Arthur has returned, but a shroud of mystery surrounds his wartime business dealings in Europe. Socialite-turned-socialist Emmeline is passionate about carving out a new niche for herself in life, one that comes with its own dangers. And idealistic, adventurous Celia, the heart of the family and the de Witt’s youngest daughter, is still desperate to spread her wings and see more of the world. To escape Stoneythorpe and the painful secrets that lie there, she moves to London and embraces life and love in the Roaring Twenties. From the brilliant young author known as one of the “queens of contemporary fiction,” The Edge of the Fall is brimming with intrigue and emotion, balancing the glamour of the era with the gritty reality of life in a world changed forever by war. It is a glorious feat of storytelling and a must-read for those who loved The Storms of War and fans of historical fiction everywhere.","1443438286, 9781443438285",False,False,432,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LDv0DAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=LDv0DAEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2016,Harper Perennial

The story involves German professor Otto Lidenbrock who believes there are volcanic tubes going toward the centre of the Earth. He, his nephew Axel, and their guide Hans descend into the Icelandic volcano Sn�fellsj�kull, encountering many adventures, including prehistoric animals and natural hazards, before eventually coming to the surface again in southern Italy, at the Stromboli volcano. The genre of subterranean fiction already existed long before Verne. However, the present book considerably added to its popularity and influenced later such writings. For example, Edgar Rice Burroughs explicitly acknowledged Verne's influence on his own Pellucidar series.","197382518X, 9781973825180",False,False,438,N/A,en,No Image,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sicFtAEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,N/A

487099a2-0ab0-41d2-8e9f-e0846240e242,fiction,Unless the Threat of Death is Behind Them,Hard-Boiled Fiction and Film Noir,John T. Irwin,"The noted literary critic delves into the psychology and significance of American hardboiled crime fiction and film noir of the 1930s and ’40s. Early in the twentieth century, American crime novelists like Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler put forward a new kind of character: the “hard-boiled” detective, as exemplified by Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon. Unlike the analytical detectives of nineteenth-century fiction, these new detectives encountered cases not as intricate logical puzzles but as stark challenges of manhood. John T. Irwin explores how the stories of these characters grapple with ideas of American masculinity. Professional codes are pitted against personal desires, resulting in either ruinous relationships or solitary integrity. In thematic conflicts between independence and subordination, all notions of manly independence prove subordinate to the hand of fate. Tracing the stylistic development of the genre, Irwin demonstrates the particular influence of the novel of manners, especially the writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald. He also shows that as hard-boiled fiction began to appear on the screen in film noir, it took on themes of female empowerment—just as women entered the workforce in large numbers. Finally, he discusses how these themes persist in contemporary dramatic series on television, representing the conflicted lives of Americans into the twenty-first century.","9780801889387, 0801889383",True,True,445,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8oMcEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8oMcEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2006,JHU Press

This 2011 Companion offers a comprehensive, authoritative and accessible overview of the diversity of American fiction since the Second World War. Essays by nineteen distinguished scholars provide critical insights into the significant genres, historical contexts, cultural diversity and major authors during a period of enormous American global political and cultural power. This power is overshadowed, nevertheless, by national anxieties growing out of events ranging from the Civil Rights Movement to the rise of feminism; from the Cold War and its fear of Communism and nuclear warfare to the Age of Terror and its different yet related fears of the 'Other'. American fiction since 1945 has faithfully chronicled these anxieties. An essential reference guide, this Companion provides a chronology of the period, as well as guides to further reading.","9781107493544, 1107493544",False,True,473,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AVXPAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=AVXPAgAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2011,Cambridge University Press

Her doctor is unable to help her and sends her off on a holiday where she meets a mystical character by the name of Raffello Cellini, a famous Italian artist. Cellini offers her a strange potion which immediately puts her into a tranquil slumber, in which she experiences divine visions. Upon wakening, she craves more. Later, she meets her unnamed guardian angel, who whisks her through infinite solar systems faster than a shooting star while human spirits fly by like gossamer silk. He shares the truth of religion and the secret of human destiny, but still she longs for more. She comes to understand God as pure light and pure love, but it's not enough that she should see and hear these things from the touch of an angel. She wants to master this ability on her own and seeks a oneness with God through a series of meditative disciplines while locked away in a monastery. Reception--The novel was rejected for publication by Hall Caine-an act that began a lifelong feud between Caine and Corelli. After hearing of Caine's harsh criticism, George Bentley suspected that the novel might have commercial appeal and published Corelli's first novel.We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

e2f25190-b027-4bce-88ec-0b82fd8ce2de,fiction,The Pearl of Lima,A Story of True Love,"Jules Verne, Anne T. Wilbur","Jules Gabriel Verne (1828 -1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright best known for his adventure novels and his profound influence on the literary genre of science fiction. Verne was born to bourgeois parents in the seaport of Nantes, where he was trained to follow in his father's footsteps as a lawyer, but quit the profession early in life to write for magazines and the stage. His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the Voyages Extraordinaires, a widely popular series of scrupulously researched adventure novels including Journey to the Center of the Earth, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Verne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism. The pioneering submarine designer Simon Lake credited his inspiration to Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and his autobiography begins ""Jules Verne was in a sense the director-general of my life."" William Beebe, Sir Ernest Shackleton, and Robert Ballard found similar early inspiration in the novel, and Jacques Cousteau called it his ""shipboard bible."" The aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont named Verne as his favorite author and the inspiration for his own elaborate flying machines. Igor Sikorsky often quoted Verne and cited his Robur the Conqueror as the inspiration for his invention of the first successful helicopter. The rocketry innovators Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert Goddard, and Hermann Oberth are all known to have taken their inspiration from Verne's From the Earth to the Moon. Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and William Anders, the astronauts on the Apollo 8 mission, were similarly inspired, with Borman commenting ""In a very real sense, Jules Verne is one of the pioneers of the space age.""

4009110b-a40a-4fae-9067-f6cce0fd56fd,fiction,The Invisible Man,N/A,H. G. Wells,"THE INVISIBLE MANThe Invisible Man is a science fiction novella by H. G. Wells. Originally serialized in Pearson's Weekly in 1897, it was published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man of the title is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it neither absorbs nor reflects light and thus becomes invisible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but fails in his attempt to reverse it.While its predecessors, The Time Machine and The Island of Doctor Moreau, were written using first-person narrators, Wells adopts a third-person objective point of view in The Invisible Man.A mysterious man, Griffin, arrives at the local inn of the English village of Iping, West Sussex, during a snowstorm. The stranger wears a long-sleeved, thick coat and gloves; his face is hidden entirely by bandages except for a fake pink nose; and he wears a wide-brimmed hat. He is excessively reclusive, irascible, and unfriendly. He demands to be left alone and spends most of his time in his rooms working with a set of chemicals and laboratory apparatus, only venturing out at night. While Griffin is staying at the inn, hundreds of strange glass bottles (that he calls his luggage) arrive. Many local townspeople believe this to be very strange. He becomes the talk of the village with many theorizing as to his origins.H. G. WellsHerbert George Wells (21 September 1866 - 13 August 1946), usually referred to as H. G. Wells, was an English writer. He was prolific in many genres, including the novel, history, politics, social commentary, and textbooks and rules for war games. Wells is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is called a ""father of science fiction"", along with Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback. His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), and The War of the Worlds (1898). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times. Wells's earliest specialised training was in biology, and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally Darwiniancontext. He was also from an early date an outspoken socialist, often (but not always, as at the beginning of the First World War) sympathising with pacifist views. His later works became increasingly political and didactic, and he wrote little science fiction, while he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of journalist. Novels like Kipps and The History of Mr Polly, which describe lower-middle-class life, led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to Charles Dickens, but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in Tono-Bungay (1909), a diagnosis of English society as a whole. A diabetic, in 1934, Wells co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (known today as Diabetes UK).Herbert George Wells was born at Atlas House, 46 High Street in Bromley, Kent, on 21 September 1866. Called ""Bertie"" in the family, he was the fourth and last child of Joseph Wells (a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer) and his wife, Sarah Neal (a former domestic servant).","1549891642, 9781549891649",False,False,98,N/A,en,No Image,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pKhoswEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,N/A

ff0663a2-e185-44a3-8642-906bbffae5cf,fiction,Gothic Reflections,Narrative Force in Nineteenth-Century Fiction,Peter Garrett,"The Gothic has long been seen as offering a subversive challenge to the norms of realism. Locating both Gothic and mainstream Victorian fiction in a larger literary and cultural field, Peter K. Garrett argues that the oppositions usually posed between them are actually at work within both. He further shows how, by offering alternative versions of its stories, nineteenth-century Gothic fiction repeatedly reflects on narrative force, the power exerted by both writers and readers.Beginning with Poe's theory and practice of the Gothic tale as an exercise (or fantasy) of authorial power, Garrett then reads earlier eighteenth-century and Romantic Gothic fiction for comparable reflexive implications. Throughout, he stresses the ways authors doubled both characters and narrative perspectives to raise issues of power and authority in the tension between central deviant figures and social norms. Garrett then shows how the great nineteenth-century monster stories Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Dracula self-consciously link the extremity and isolation of their deviant figures with the social groups they confront. These narratives, he argues, move from a Romantic concern with individual creation and responsibility to a Victorian affirmation of social solidarity that also reveals its dependence on the binding force of exclusionary violence. The final section of the book extends its investigation of Gothic reflections on narrative force into the more realistic social and psychological fiction of Dickens, Eliot, and James.","9781501724282, 1501724282",False,False,249,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tJRlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tJRlDwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2018,Cornell University Press

With the rise of science and technology in the 19th century, and our continually improving understanding of the cosmos, writers and thinkers soon began to imagine futures greatly different from the present. Science fiction was born out of the realization that future technoscientific advances could dramatically change the world. Along with the developments described in modern science fiction - space societies, conscious machines, and upgraded human bodies, to name but a few - come a new set of ethical challenges and new forms of ethics. Blackford identifies these issues and their reflection in science fiction. His fascinating book will appeal to anyone with an interest in philosophy or science fiction, or in how they interact. “This is a seasoned, balanced analysis of a major issue in our thinking about the future, seen through the lens of science fiction, a central art of our time.

Blackford identifies these issues and their reflection in science fiction. His fascinating book will appeal to anyone with an interest in philosophy or science fiction, or in how they interact. “This is a seasoned, balanced analysis of a major issue in our thinking about the future, seen through the lens of science fiction, a central art of our time. Everyone from humanists to technologists should study these ideas and examples. Blackford’s book is wise and savvy, and a delight to read as well.” Greg Benford, author of Timescape.","3319616838, 9783319616834",False,False,204,Philosophy,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c6B5swEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=c6B5swEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,Springer

Winner of the American Book Award for Fiction His life of crime began at the age of ten, after he crossed the Atlantic with his family and landed in America. Starting as the leader of the most violent Irish street gang in Hell’s Kitchen, the young immigrant rose to prominence as the leading brewer and bootlegger in Prohibition-era New York. In due course, he also became Mae West’s lover; the founder and proprietor of the Cotton Club; the owner of five heavyweight champions; the man who gave his childhood friend George Raft his big break in Hollywood; and more. This vivid historical novel, written in the form of a fictionalized memoir, uses Madden’s voice to trace his life from his boyhood in England to his early twentieth-century heyday and beyond. “A bright romp, with enough period detail and dialogue to fill ten Cagney films.” —Kirkus Reviews “Reminiscent of Roddy Doyle's novel A Star Called Henry.” —Booklist “A tale that feels remarkably authentic.” —Hartford Courant","9781940941448, 194094144X",True,True,545,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dTVgAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dTVgAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2015,Diversion Books

That something turns about to be a highly valuable meteorite. With euro signs lighting up the eyes of the locals, the unexpected treasure is temporarily placed in a neighbourhood museum, under the watchful eye of a priest named Joel. But Joel has a lot more on his mind than simply protecting the riches that have apparently rained down from heaven. His wife has just revealed that she is pregnant.

9a4d9c6c-7350-4997-b12f-d9aa30261a36,fiction,Whose Life is it Anyway?,N/A,Sinéad Moriarty,"Also published under the title Keeping It In the Family. In her fifth novel, Whose Life Is It Anyway?, Sinéad Moriarty has done it again: taken a complex topic - what happens when a young woman falls in love with someone dramatically different than the kind of man her family would have expected - and created an insightful, gripping and moving story filled with delightfully sparky characters, plenty of straight-talking, and all her trademark fun and humour. In balancing of light and shade, pathos and comedy, Sinéad manages to pull off a unique feat - a story that combines the provocative qualities of a Jodi Picoult story with the warmth and humour of Marian Keyes. It's tricky for Niamh O'Flaherty, growing up in a North London home that's a shrine to all things Irish. But it's even trickier being an adult and realizing that her family expects her to settle down with a nice Irish lad, especially now that she's living in Dublin. When Niamh finally meets the love of her life he is the last person she would expect to fall for her. Pierre is older and an intellectual, but she loves his ability to laugh at himself, his calmness and strength of character, and, of course, his stunning looks. There's just one problem: if Pierre's parents - Jean and Fleur - are sniffy about their pride and joy hooking up with a girl who writes a fluffy newspaper column, her parents, Mick and Annie, are going to go ballistic when they hear that their daughter intends to marry someone who couldn't be less Irish if he tried . . . Sinéad Moriarty's novels have sold over half a million copies in Ireland and the UK and she is a four times nominee for the popular fiction Irish Book Award. She has won over readers and critics telling stories that are funny, humane, moving and relevant to modern women. Whose Life Is It Anyway? is Sinéad at her very best. Sinéad Moriarty lives with her family in Dublin. Her other titles are: The Baby Trail; A Perfect Match; From Here to Maternity; In My Sister's Shoes; Pieces of My Heart; Me and My Sisters and This Child of Mine.","9780141908489, 0141908483",True,False,374,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PBLjuTl81JEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PBLjuTl81JEC&source=gbs_api,2009,Penguin UK

The alien is Scott Gale, member of a four-person team send from Earth to the planet Torin to research its environment. Separated from the rest of the crew before landing, Scott is rescued by members of Brin's Five. He quickly learns their language and becomes part of the family. However, he and Brin's Five are forced to flee their home when the cruel leader of Torin, Tiath Pentroy, arrives, searching for Scott. Tiath views Scott and the powerful technology of the ship that brought him from beyond the stars as a threat to his rule . . . but also potential assets that could make him invincible. Tiath will stop at nothing until both are in his grasp. On the run from Tiath and his spies, Scott and his adoptive family have only one hope for survival: If they can reach the fabulous city of Rintoul, Scott might be able to use his Earth technology to prove himself worthy of protection. But with their pursuers never far behind, Scott and the rest of Brin's Five are in a race against time to reach their hoped-for sanctuary before the dread ruler can catch them . . . and end the alien threat for good.","1504038215, 9781504038218",False,False,210,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7ErFswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7ErFswEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,Open Road Distribution

Randisi, Laura Oles, Isabella Maldonado, Jeffery Hess, Neil Plakcy, John M. Floyd, M.E. Browning","Jimmy Buffett is one of the great contemporary singer/songwriters, and it’s hard to imagine a citizen of Planet Earth unfamiliar with such classic hits as “Margaritaville.” Jimmy has also written novels, children’s books, memoirs, and a stage musical based on Herman Wouk’s Don’t Stop the Carnival, and his family-friendly concerts almost always sell out to audiences comprised of a mix of dedicated Parrotheads, casual fans, and newbies. In The Great Filling Station Holdup, editor Josh Pachter presents sixteen short crime stories by sixteen popular and up-and-coming crime writers, each story based on a song from one of the twenty-nine studio albums Jimmy has released over the last half century, from Leigh Lundin’s take on “Truckstop Salvation” (which appeared on Jimmy’s first LP, 1970’s Down to Earth) to M.E. Browning’s interpretation of “Einstein Was a Surfer” (from 2013’s Songs from St. Somewhere). If you love Jimmy’s music or crime fiction or both, you’ll love The Great Filling Station Holdup. Mix yourself a boat drink, ask Alexa to put on a buffet of Buffett tunes, kick back, and enjoy!

One of the first works of juvenile fiction to feature exclusively juvenile heroes, the story relates the adventures of three boys marooned on a South Pacific island, the only survivors of a shipwreck. A typical Robinsonade - a genre of fiction inspired by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe - and one of the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.","1548750506, 9781548750503",False,False,166,N/A,en,No Image,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m2oxswEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,N/A

The book is sailor Ishmael's narrative of the obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for revenge on Moby Dick, the white whale that on the ship's previous voyage bit off Ahab's leg at the knee.Herman Melville's epic tale about obsession and greed shows no signs of losing popularity in the digital age. The book begins as a straightforward narrative in realistic prose.After the first fifteen chapters, it becomes a complex combination of action, philosophy, and sea adventure narrative written in rhapsodic metaphorical style. A profound symbolic study of good and evil, Moby Dick is widely regarded as one of the great American novels.A contribution to the literature of the American Renaissance, the work's genre classifications range from late Romantic to early Symbolist. Moby-Dick was published to mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, and was out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891. Its reputation as a ""Great American Novel"" was established only in the 20th century, after the centennial of its author's birth. William Faulkner confessed he wished he had written the book himself, and D. H.

His major inspiration and invention was cosmic horror: the idea that life is incomprehensible to human minds and that the universe is fundamentally alien. Those who genuinely reason, like his protagonists, gamble with sanity. He has developed a cult following for his Cthulhu Mythos, a series of loosely interconnected fictions featuring a pantheon of human-nullifying entities, as well as the Necronomicon, a fictional grimoire of magical rites and forbidden lore. His works were deeply pessimistic and cynical, challenging the values of Enlightenment, Romanticist, and Christian humanism. Lovecraft's protagonists usually achieve the mirror-opposite of traditional gnosis and mysticism by momentarily glimpsing the horror of ultimate reality. Although Lovecraft's readership was limited during his life, his reputation has grown over the decades, and he is now commonly regarded as one of the most influential horror writers of the 20th century, exerting widespread and indirect influence, and frequently compared to Edgar Allan Poe.","1409936546, 9781409936541",False,False,48,Electronic books,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n5QsPQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=n5QsPQAACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2008,Dodo Press

Unless you're a mathematician, the chances of you reading any novels about geometry are probably slender. But if you read only one in your life, this should be at the top of your list. Flatland imagines a two-dimensional world inhabited by sentient geometric shapes who think their planar world is all there is. But one Flatlander, a Square, discovers the existence of a third dimension and the limits of his world's assumptions about reality and comes to understand the confusing problem of higher dimensions.

b6ce577e-6785-4c9e-b6cc-62e7c3fda66a,fiction,Dissenting Fictions,Identity and Resistance in the Contemporary American Novel,Cathy Moses,"This study elucidates the relationship between identity formation and resistance to racial and sexual oppression in a group of contemporary American novels the author terms dissenting fictions, narratives that assert the subjectivity and historicity of marginalized peoples at precisely the moment when postmodern critiques proclaim the death of the subject and the inaccessibility of historical truth. Of primary concern is the question of how narrative fictions conceive of strategies of resistance to oppression in an age in which the identity politics of the sixties and seventies have given way to positional subjectivities, fluid identities, and coalition politics. Through interpretive readings of the works of well-known authors Toni Morrison and Leslie Marmon Silko, critically acclaimed novelist David Bradley, the well-respected but little-studied novelist Russell Banks, and the relatively unknown Leslie Feinberg, whose fiction challenges accepted notions of gender, the author explores a range of practices that place notions of identity in crucial relationship to resistance praxis. Dissenting fictions emerge in this study as imaginative narratives that perform substantial cultural work, reworking classical liberal notions of subjectivity and agency. These novels address the failure of conventional individual agency and imagine an interactive agency grounded in an awareness of both a political economy and historic power relations.","9781135706302, 1135706301",False,True,187,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=isqlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=isqlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2014,Routledge

Still the UK detains people indefinitely under immigration rules. Bail hearings go unrecorded, people are picked up without notice, individuals feel abandoned in detention centres with no way of knowing when they will be released.

Poets, novelists and writers have once again collaborated with people who have experienced detention, their tales appearing alongside first-hand accounts by people who themselves have been detained.

Westfahl shows that hard science fiction is generally characterized by the author's extreme concern for scientific accuracy and logic. Identifying two characteristic forms of hard science fiction, Westfahl closely examines several representative works: Arthur C. Clarke's A Fall of Moondust, Hal Clement's Mission of Gravity, and Charles Sheffield's Between the Strokes of Midnight.

37caa869-e855-4a05-b26e-10f31aaab9a3,fiction,Soviet Fiction Since Stalin,"Science, Politics and Literature","Rosalind J Marsh, Taylor & Francis Group","First published in 1986, Soviet Fiction since Stalin presents a comprehensive overview of the literature of the post Stalin period in the Soviet Union. The rapid advances in science and technology in these years are reflected in the themes of many of the major novelists - Pasternak, Solzhenitsyn, Sinyavsky, Daniel and Grossman- and scientific subjects frequently offer a vehicle for the exploration of the wider socio-political, moral, and philosophical ideas. As the period advances, however, literature becomes the first medium in which to express mistrust of scientific advance, and hence, indirectly, of Soviet policy as a whole. Rosalind J. Marsh uses a broad definition of 'science' which enables her to cover topics ranging from de-Stalinization, nationalism, and anti- Semitism in science, to Lysenko and scientific charlatanism, the Soviet rejection of relativity theory and quantum mechanics, the atom bomb, and also such general problems as secrecy, careerism, and bureaucracy. The bulk of the book concentrates on the Khrushchev years but there is also plentiful discussion of more recent writing such as that of Zinoviev and Voinovich. This book will be of interest to students and researchers of Soviet literature, Russian Literature and literature in general.","1032216670, 9781032216676",False,False,350,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1rSxzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1rSxzgEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2022,Routledge

This book sets out to demonstrate a discernible pattern of concerns that cut across Moore's fictive output over the last 40 years.

8f0d1ce7-6cb1-4794-93ea-44e9d03473ec,fiction,Italian Science Fiction,The Other in Literature and Film,"Simone Brioni, Daniele Comberiati","This book explores Italian science fiction from 1861, the year of Italy’s unification, to the present day, focusing on how this genre helped shape notions of Otherness and Normalness. In particular, Italian Science Fiction draws upon critical race studies, postcolonial theory, and feminist studies to explore how migration, colonialism, multiculturalism, and racism have been represented in genre film and literature. Topics include the role of science fiction in constructing a national identity; the representation and self-representation of “alien” immigrants in Italy; the creation of internal “Others,” such as southerners and Roma; the intersections of gender and race discrimination; and Italian science fiction’s transnational dialogue with foreign science fiction. This book reveals that though it is arguably a minor genre in Italy, science fiction offers an innovative interpretive angle for rethinking Italian history and imagining future change in Italian society.","9783030193263, 3030193268",True,True,298,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lOijDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lOijDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2019,Springer

69d277be-20e2-4cea-b176-7721548de2ac,fiction,Hard to Be Good,Stories,Bill Barich,"In his first collection of short fiction, Bill Barich gives us cause to celebrate a prose stylist who can gracefully cross the boundaries of genre. As stated by Anne Tyler, Hard to Be Good is so large and complete that you tend to look up at the end and find yourself surprised that it’s still the same day. Set in the American West, as are three other of the seven stories in this book, it is about the unselfconscious struggle for wholeness in a divided family. Its adolescent protagonist moves from innocence to experience in the course of a summer vacation with his mother and her third husband, and the result is satisfying, rather than harrowing. The attempt to make signification relationships cohere, to weather the transformation of innocence, informs all the stories in this book, and in Barich’s worlds the outcome is often good—knowledge does not always lead to hopelessness. Highly disparate mothers covering on a couple in Idaho Falls (“Where the Mountains Are”) have much to teach and learn, a nineteen-year-old American studying in Florence accepts the surprising human complications of an outsider’s great pensione adventure (“Caravaggio”) . . . and that’s just a few of Barich’s brilliant stories. Hard to Be Good is a book of real feeling, breadth, and narrative movement. As Frederick Exley wrote, “Barich is a splendidly gifted writer.” Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade, Yucca, and Good Books imprints, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction—novels, novellas, political and medical thrillers, comedy, satire, historical fiction, romance, erotic and love stories, mystery, classic literature, folklore and mythology, literary classics including Shakespeare, Dumas, Wilde, Cather, and much more.

Randisi, Laura Oles, Isabella Maldonado, Jeffery Hess, Neil Plakcy, John M. Floyd, M.E. Browning","Jimmy Buffett is one of the great contemporary singer/songwriters, and it’s hard to imagine a citizen of Planet Earth unfamiliar with such classic hits as “Margaritaville.” Jimmy has also written novels, children’s books, memoirs, and a stage musical based on Herman Wouk’s Don’t Stop the Carnival, and his family-friendly concerts almost always sell out to audiences comprised of a mix of dedicated Parrotheads, casual fans, and newbies. In The Great Filling Station Holdup, editor Josh Pachter presents sixteen short crime stories by sixteen popular and up-and-coming crime writers, each story based on a song from one of the twenty-nine studio albums Jimmy has released over the last half century, from Leigh Lundin’s take on “Truckstop Salvation” (which appeared on Jimmy’s first LP, 1970’s Down to Earth) to M.E.

One of the first works of juvenile fiction to feature exclusively juvenile heroes, the story relates the adventures of three boys marooned on a South Pacific island, the only survivors of a shipwreck. A typical Robinsonade - a genre of fiction inspired by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe - and one of the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.","1548750506, 9781548750503",False,False,166,N/A,en,No Image,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m2oxswEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,N/A

The book is sailor Ishmael's narrative of the obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for revenge on Moby Dick, the white whale that on the ship's previous voyage bit off Ahab's leg at the knee.Herman Melville's epic tale about obsession and greed shows no signs of losing popularity in the digital age. The book begins as a straightforward narrative in realistic prose.After the first fifteen chapters, it becomes a complex combination of action, philosophy, and sea adventure narrative written in rhapsodic metaphorical style. A profound symbolic study of good and evil, Moby Dick is widely regarded as one of the great American novels.A contribution to the literature of the American Renaissance, the work's genre classifications range from late Romantic to early Symbolist. Moby-Dick was published to mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, and was out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891. Its reputation as a ""Great American Novel"" was established only in the 20th century, after the centennial of its author's birth. William Faulkner confessed he wished he had written the book himself, and D. H. Lawrence called it ""one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world"" and ""the greatest book of the sea ever written"".Its opening sentence, ""Call me Ishmael"", is among world literature's most famous.","1726793834, 9781726793834",False,False,546,"Ahab, Captain (Fictitious character)",en,No Image,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=HGbuywEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2018,N/A

Lovecraft,"Howard Phillips Lovecraft (1890-1937) was an American author of horror, fantasy, and science fiction, known then simply as weird fiction. His major inspiration and invention was cosmic horror: the idea that life is incomprehensible to human minds and that the universe is fundamentally alien. Those who genuinely reason, like his protagonists, gamble with sanity. He has developed a cult following for his Cthulhu Mythos, a series of loosely interconnected fictions featuring a pantheon of human-nullifying entities, as well as the Necronomicon, a fictional grimoire of magical rites and forbidden lore. His works were deeply pessimistic and cynical, challenging the values of Enlightenment, Romanticist, and Christian humanism. Lovecraft's protagonists usually achieve the mirror-opposite of traditional gnosis and mysticism by momentarily glimpsing the horror of ultimate reality. Although Lovecraft's readership was limited during his life, his reputation has grown over the decades, and he is now commonly regarded as one of the most influential horror writers of the 20th century, exerting widespread and indirect influence, and frequently compared to Edgar Allan Poe.","1409936546, 9781409936541",False,False,48,Electronic books,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n5QsPQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=n5QsPQAACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2008,Dodo Press

Unless you're a mathematician, the chances of you reading any novels about geometry are probably slender. But if you read only one in your life, this should be at the top of your list. Flatland imagines a two-dimensional world inhabited by sentient geometric shapes who think their planar world is all there is. But one Flatlander, a Square, discovers the existence of a third dimension and the limits of his world's assumptions about reality and comes to understand the confusing problem of higher dimensions.

1cb66eea-7b39-4d2b-aa49-89783e8b68c0,fiction,Dissenting Fictions,Identity and Resistance in the Contemporary American Novel,Cathy Moses,"This study elucidates the relationship between identity formation and resistance to racial and sexual oppression in a group of contemporary American novels the author terms dissenting fictions, narratives that assert the subjectivity and historicity of marginalized peoples at precisely the moment when postmodern critiques proclaim the death of the subject and the inaccessibility of historical truth. Of primary concern is the question of how narrative fictions conceive of strategies of resistance to oppression in an age in which the identity politics of the sixties and seventies have given way to positional subjectivities, fluid identities, and coalition politics. Through interpretive readings of the works of well-known authors Toni Morrison and Leslie Marmon Silko, critically acclaimed novelist David Bradley, the well-respected but little-studied novelist Russell Banks, and the relatively unknown Leslie Feinberg, whose fiction challenges accepted notions of gender, the author explores a range of practices that place notions of identity in crucial relationship to resistance praxis. Dissenting fictions emerge in this study as imaginative narratives that perform substantial cultural work, reworking classical liberal notions of subjectivity and agency. These novels address the failure of conventional individual agency and imagine an interactive agency grounded in an awareness of both a political economy and historic power relations.","9781135706302, 1135706301",False,True,187,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=isqlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=isqlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,2014,Routledge

Still the UK detains people indefinitely under immigration rules. Bail hearings go unrecorded, people are picked up without notice, individuals feel abandoned in detention centres with no way of knowing when they will be released. In Refugee Tales III we read the stories of people who have been through this process, many of whom have yet to see their cases resolved and who live in fear that at any moment they might be detained again. Poets, novelists and writers have once again collaborated with people who have experienced detention, their tales appearing alongside first-hand accounts by people who themselves have been detained.

Identifying two characteristic forms of hard science fiction, Westfahl closely examines several representative works: Arthur C. Clarke's A Fall of Moondust, Hal Clement's Mission of Gravity, and Charles Sheffield's Between the Strokes of Midnight.

571a7c52-d22c-4a55-b864-9c1ff092f644,fiction,Soviet Fiction Since Stalin,"Science, Politics and Literature","Rosalind J Marsh, Taylor & Francis Group","First published in 1986, Soviet Fiction since Stalin presents a comprehensive overview of the literature of the post Stalin period in the Soviet Union. The rapid advances in science and technology in these years are reflected in the themes of many of the major novelists - Pasternak, Solzhenitsyn, Sinyavsky, Daniel and Grossman- and scientific subjects frequently offer a vehicle for the exploration of the wider socio-political, moral, and philosophical ideas. As the period advances, however, literature becomes the first medium in which to express mistrust of scientific advance, and hence, indirectly, of Soviet policy as a whole. Rosalind J. Marsh uses a broad definition of 'science' which enables her to cover topics ranging from de-Stalinization, nationalism, and anti- Semitism in science, to Lysenko and scientific charlatanism, the Soviet rejection of relativity theory and quantum mechanics, the atom bomb, and also such general problems as secrecy, careerism, and bureaucracy. The bulk of the book concentrates on the Khrushchev years but there is also plentiful discussion of more recent writing such as that of Zinoviev and Voinovich. This book will be of interest to students and researchers of Soviet literature, Russian Literature and literature in general.","1032216670, 9781032216676",False,False,350,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1rSxzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=1rSxzgEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2022,Routledge

In 1943, when the United States learns that Germany is on the verge of a deadly innovation that could tip the balance of the war, the government turns to an unlikely source for help: the nation’s top science fiction writers. Installed at a covert military lab within the Philadelphia Naval Yard are the most brilliant of these young visionaries. The unruly band is led by Robert Heinlein, the dashing and complicated master of the genre. His “Kamikaze Group,” which includes the ambitious genius Isaac Asimov, is tasked with transforming the wonders of science fiction into science fact and unlocking the secrets to invisibility, death rays, force fields, weather control, and other astounding phenomena—and finding it harder than they ever imagined. When a German spy washes ashore near the abandoned Long Island ruins of a mysterious energy facility, the military begins to fear that the Nazis are a step ahead of Heinlein’s group. Now the oddball team, joined by old friends from the Pulp Era including L. Ron Hubbard (court-martialed for attacking Mexico), must race to catch up. The answers they seek may be locked in the legendary War of Currents, which was fought decades earlier between Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. As the threat of an imminent Nazi invasion of America grows more and more possible, events are set in motion that just may revolutionize the future—or destroy it—while forcing the writers to challenge the limits of talent, imagination, love, destiny, and even reality itself. Blazing at breathtaking speed from forgotten tunnels deep beneath Manhattan to top-secret battles in the North Pacific, and careening from truth to pulp and back again, The Astounding, the Amazing, and the Unknown is a sweeping, romantic epic—a page-turning rocket ship ride through the history of the future.","9781439168950, 1439168954",True,False,434,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=43ipZ4yXUY8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=43ipZ4yXUY8C&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2011,Simon and Schuster

392e5cf6-a224-46b8-b93a-5e37f07bb3d7,fiction,Bleak House,N/A,Charles Dickens,"Bleak House is one of Charles Dickens's major novels, first published as a serial between March 1852 and September 1853. The novel has many characters and several sub-plots, and the story is told partly by the novel's heroine, Esther Summerson, and partly by an omniscient narrator. At the centre of Bleak House is the long-running legal case, Jarndyce and Jarndyce, which came about because someone wrote several conflicting wills. This legal case is used by Dickens to satirise the English judicial system, and he makes use of his earlier experiences as a law clerk, and as a litigant seeking to enforce copyright on his earlier books.Though the legal profession criticised Dickens's satire as exaggerated, this novel helped support a judicial reform movement, which culminated in the enactment of legal reform in the 1870s.There is some debate among scholars as to when Bleak House is set. The English legal historian Sir William Holdsworth sets the action in 1827; however, reference to preparation for the building of a railway in Chapter LV suggests the 1830s.","1544191863, 9781544191867",False,False,529,N/A,en,No Image,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Hq7bAQAACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2017,N/A

It’s Dr. Kay Scarpetta’s birthday, and she’s about to head to Miami for a vacation with Benton Wesley, her FBI profiler husband, when she notices seven pennies on a wall behind their Cambridge house. Is this a kids’ game? If so, why are all of the coins dated 1981 and so shiny they could be newly minted? Her cellphone rings, and Detective Pete Marino tells her there’s been a homicide five minutes away. A high school music teacher has been shot with uncanny precision as he unloaded groceries from his car. No one has heard or seen a thing. In this 22nd Scarpetta novel, the master forensic sleuth finds herself in the unsettling pursuit of a serial sniper who leaves no incriminating evidence except fragments of copper. The shots seem impossible, yet they are so perfect they cause instant death. The victims appear to have had nothing in common, and there is no pattern to indicate where the killer will strike next. First New Jersey, then Massachusetts, and then the murky depths off the coast of South Florida, where Scarpetta investigates a shipwreck, looking for answers that only she can discover and analyze. And it is there that she comes face to face with shocking evidence that implicates her techno genius niece, Lucy, Scarpetta’s own flesh and blood. “When it comes to the forensic sciences, nobody can touch Cornwell.” —NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW","9781443436724, 1443436720",True,False,396,Fiction,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ln6BAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,1,3,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ln6BAwAAQBAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2014,Harper Collins

Verbal inspiration may enter the berth of a mariner on board a ship frozen fast in a river in the middle of a town; and since saints are supposed to look benignantly on humble believers, I indulge in the pleasant fancy that the shade of old Flaubert--who imagined himself to be (among other things) a descendant of Vikings--might have hovered with amused interest over the docks of a 2,000-ton steamer called the Adowa, on board of which, gripped by the inclement winter alongside a quay in Rouen, the tenth chapter of ""Almayer's Folly"" was begun.

Mrs Darling half-remembers Peter Pan from her own childhood; he is an insubstantial figure with a baby's laugh and a habit of blowing out stars. She believes him to be imaginary - until he leaves his shadow in her children's nursery. Accompanied by a foul-mouthed fairy, Peter is in search of good stories, and upon learning that the eldest Darling girl, Wendy, knows a great many, he lures her and her two brothers back to the island of Neverland. There, the dreams and imaginings of childhood become real. Lost boys, pirates and warring Indians populate the shifting landscape, which suddenly seems darker and more frightening without the bedside lamps of home. Adapted by J. M. Barrie (1860-1937) from his most famous play, this novelised and illustrated version of the story was first published in 1911.","110806034X, 9781108060349",False,False,0,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fDldmgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fDldmgEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2013,Cambridge University Press
d503e00f-e07e-48ab-8756-f62f6d071a26,fiction,"James Joyce, Science, and Modernist Print Culture",The Einstein of English Fiction,Jeffrey S. Drouin,"This book makes an important intervention in the ongoing debates about modernism, science, and the divisions of early Twentieth-Century print culture. In order to establish Joyce's place in the nexus of modernism and scientific thought, Drouin uses the methods of periodical studies and textual criticism to examine the impact of Einstein's relativity theories on the development of Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939). Looking at experiments with space, time, motion, and perspective, it rigorously surveys discourse of science and the novel in the print culture networks connected to Joyce, with concrete analysis of avant-garde magazines, newspapers, popular science books, BBC pamphlets, and radio broadcasts between 1914 and 1939. These sources elucidate changes that Joyce made to the manuscripts, typescripts, and page proofs of certain episodes of his final two novels. The new evidence establishes for the first time the nature of the material link between Joyce and non-technical science, and the manner in which Ulysses and Finnegans Wake owe their structure and meaning to the humanistic issues associated with science during the wartime and inter-war years. In examining the relationships between Joyce's later work and the popular science industry, the book elucidates the often conflicting attitudes toward science in inter-war British print culture, filling in a piece of the puzzle that is modernism's relationship to the new physics and, simultaneously, the history of the novel.","1317541480, 9781317541486",False,False,166,Literary Criticism,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XtWijgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XtWijgEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2015,Routledge

Fletcher, one of the most prolific, leading writers of the Golden Age of detective fiction and first published in 1920, the novel still enjoys great popularity among fans of quick-paced stories that involve complicated mysteries and pure-hearted amateur investigators. The narrator of the story is a young man called Hugh Moneylaws, a clerk in the office of a lawyer called Mr. Lindsey in Berwick-Upon-Tweed, a small and quiet town on the border between England and Scotland. Hugh is on an errand that he undertakes from a mysterious lodger in his mother's boarding house in order to supplement his salary when he comes across a dead body - the first in the line of many, the story featuring a high body count. As the investigation goes on, Hugh travels to all sorts of places by train, by ship and other vehicles and gets into all sorts of dangerous situations that he manages to escape miraculously, very often with the help of his employer who is also the brains behind the entire investigation.The mystery is complicated, but also predictable to a certain extent. However, that does not make the novel less enjoyable - the plot comes with beautiful, remote places, closely-knit communities that have their own rules and laws, excellently-penned characters, principal and minor alike, lots of humorous events and adventures that will make the reader laugh out loud and a romantic story line that makes it all even more exciting.",9798704511281,False,False,274,N/A,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N2M2zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,False,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=N2M2zgEACAAJ&dq=fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,2021,N/A

In her novels and poems Atwood's protagonists explore the lives of their mothers and grandmothers in order to reflect on the lives and struggles we confront today. Using the metaphor of narcissism-both progressive and regressive-and the mirror imagery that threads through Atwood's work, Hengen gives a feminist reading to the work of this important Canadian author. Hengen argues that the connections women are able to make between their own lives today and the lives portrayed by Atwood account in part for the writer's wide popularity.
